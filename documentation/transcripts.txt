Intro

[Music]
0:06
in the very early 90s floppy disks
0:08
were still the default storage medium we
0:10
all used
0:11
a standard floppy disk for pc could only
0:14
store up to one point for the four
0:15
megabytes of data
0:16
[Music]
0:19
some years later more and more people
0:21
connected their computers to the
0:22
internet
0:23
but used stylup connection that was slow
0:26
expensive
0:27
and you couldn't even use your phone at
0:28
the same time
0:33
as computers became more and more
0:34
capable of handling multimedia
0:37
we wanted more pictures sounds music
0:40
that neither of the disks nor internet
0:42
at the time could give us
0:45
but it was time for a new storage medium
0:47
to shine
0:49
the compact disc with a compact disc or
0:53
a cd you could suddenly have access to
0:55
650 megabytes of data
0:57
enough space for video music sounds text
1:00
and pictures
1:01
[Music]
1:07
and this gave rise to very particular
1:08
type of software
1:10
software with information that we
1:12
previously could only get from books and
1:13
maps
1:16
this is called reference software and
1:18
today we're going to take a closer look
1:20
at a few of them
Encyclopedia of Space
1:35
first we're going to have a look at this
1:37
nice box here
1:38
the encyclopedia of space and the
1:40
universe
1:49
the ultimate interactive learning trip
1:51
to outer space
1:54
there are so many nice pictures here
1:56
like this
1:57
star dome sky watching
2:02
solar system explained
2:10
this is the lunar moon probe
2:14
[Music]
2:20
and inside here we can see
2:24
i guess the cd
2:27
and also a small book
2:48
so
3:30
so
Lunar Moon Probe
3:58
oh
4:05
[Music]
4:21
okay and that's also a nice start so i'm
4:24
not going to go
4:25
to everything here but going to take a
4:30
quick look at some different different
4:32
things
4:34
let's try skywatching
4:45
space observatories
4:56
in space optical telescopes can produce
4:58
clearer more detailed pictures
5:01
[Music]
5:02
or maybe i can press that button in
5:05
space
5:06
optical telescopes can produce clearer
5:08
more detailed pictures
5:10
than they can on earth where the
5:12
atmosphere distorts the light from
5:14
distant objects
5:16
satellites can also be deployed in space
5:19
to collect the types of radiation
5:21
that are blocked by our atmosphere space
5:24
observatories are launched by rockets
5:27
or released into orbit from the space
5:36
shuttle
5:39
activities maybe i can do something
5:43
something fun land on the moon
5:51
level 1 start
5:56
control the thrust of the landing module
5:58
to
5:59
achieve a successful landing
6:21
okay this takes a long time
6:29
go down faster
6:37
no
6:40
but i have no thrust but it's
6:43
increasing in altitude why
6:55
i have no view left
6:58
oops oops
7:10
[Music]
7:14
oops
7:16
try something else launch the rocket
7:22
drag rocket stages onto the launch pad
7:25
to build skylab saturn v
7:29
saturn 1b
7:48
oh we have a video here saturn v takes
7:51
off
7:56
ignition sequence start six
8:00
five four three two
8:04
one zero all engine runner
8:07
liftoff we have a liftoff 32 minutes
8:11
past the hour lift up on apollo 11.
8:16
i think we've got a roll tower
8:36
okay so we have
8:41
need to try to remember how it looks
8:44
what it looks like
8:45
so that's engine
8:49
first stage second stage third stage
8:55
was this one or i think it was this one
9:00
and then this one
9:07
i can't do it
9:10
there
9:20
um
9:48
no
9:50
okay let's just try this and then
10:03
incorrect assembly
10:22
this perhaps
10:30
liftoff
Quest Master
10:41
that's awesome against here quest master
10:53
space new game
11:14
space okay one player
11:42
what is fred whipple's area of interest
11:47
i have no idea um
11:57
what is the boundary of a black hole
11:59
called event horizontally
12:06
what what theory was proposed by fred
12:09
hoyle
12:14
that's
12:18
i don't know
12:22
i know it's not this one
12:29
but
12:36
um i'm going to go with
12:39
the one here oops
12:43
next which are the main elements of
12:48
the clouds of the interstellar medium
13:02
i think it's this one um
13:06
i don't know yeah
13:10
jupiter's volume is so many times
13:12
greater than of the earth
13:20
jupiter
13:29
i'll go ahead and select 1300 times yeah
13:34
approximately how many stars does the
13:36
milky way galaxy contain
13:45
stars that's got to be many many stars
13:50
what end of game okay
14:02
okay let's go ahead and look at the next
14:04
city
Encyclopedia
14:06
and this is the next piece of software
14:08
we're going to take a look at
14:09
encyclopedia of history history as it
14:13
happened
14:13
witnessed the key relevance of the last
14:15
4 million years
14:17
amazing so there is not that much
14:21
inside the box so we are just going to
14:24
take a bit look at the box itself here
14:34
as in the back side of the box so here
14:36
it says
14:37
4 million years over 3 000 screens
14:41
800 000 words 50 animations and films
14:45
2 000 subject to subject links stuff
14:47
like that especially
14:49
sound files and animations and films and
14:51
such
14:53
that was a big deal back in the day and
14:55
look here it is mmx optimized
14:58
enhanced video performance on pcs
15:00
featuring intel's pentium processors
15:02
with mmx technology
15:04
all right i also think it's so much fun
15:06
to look at the system requirements here
15:09
it says actually windows 95 only cpu is
15:12
a 486 dx 33 megahertz
15:16
12 megabytes of ram double speed cd-rom
15:20
yeah i think we are good
15:32
yeah the only thing in the box is this
15:38
cd
15:52
so
16:03
[Music]
16:37
that was a nice introduction
16:43
and they are not done yet
16:53
or i guess i'm supposed to
16:57
press something
17:12
east africa
17:15
early humans stand tall on rear legs
17:22
hominids improve their survival skills
17:29
homo erectus emerges
17:36
[Music]
17:43
in 1368 the ming dynasty came to power
17:47
freeing china from the mighty mongol
17:50
empire
17:51
the autocratic china became the largest
17:54
and wealthiest state
17:58
this is nice these short videos
18:06
the ming government was gradually
18:08
weakened by ineffectual emperors
18:11
they were unable to resist a new threat
18:14
from manchu tribesmen in the north
18:16
and in 1644 the ming dynasty fell
18:20
[Music]
18:25
back in
18:31
oh there's more hair
18:40
vampires
18:44
[Music]
18:54
uh
18:59
can i do something here can i
19:08
american independence is declared
19:12
okay so they try to make it interesting
19:14
at least
19:16
and uh
19:19
i guess it kind of works snapshots
19:26
inventions
19:30
ford builds the model t
19:34
let's look at the other side here
19:43
[Music]
19:50
film
20:00
oh we're now in the approach phase
20:04
everything looking good
20:06
40 feet down two and a half picking up
20:08
some dust
20:10
30 feet two and a half down fake shadow
20:13
the eagle has landed
20:18
that's one
20:19
[Music]
20:30
well i must say it has a nice interface
20:32
and
20:34
lots of uh videos so that's nice
20:39
but let's go to the next uh cd
Atlas
20:42
and this is the last box we're going to
20:44
take a look at today
20:46
captain's interactive world atlas from
20:48
1997
20:51
discover every country in the world
20:55
and you can see it has detailed
20:58
satellite and country maps
20:59
and 3d flights nice
21:06
designs for microsoft windows 95
21:56
so
22:24
so
22:38
okay
22:52
so
Earth
23:06
[Music]
23:31
the world
23:35
okay what to do
23:48
earth
23:50
the greenhouse effect occurs when the
23:52
sun's heat is trapped at the earth's
23:54
surface by gases such as carbon dioxide
23:57
methane nitrous oxide and
24:00
chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere
24:02
like the glass and a greenhouse these
24:05
gases reflect the heat back to the
24:07
earth's surface
24:08
where it is retained this is commonly
24:10
referred to
24:11
as the greenhouse effect the burning of
24:14
fossil fuels such as coal and oil
24:17
releases large
24:18
amounts of carbon dioxide in the last
24:21
century the earth's surface temperature
24:23
has risen by one degree fahrenheit
24:26
some scientists blame the greenhouse
24:28
effect for recent extremes of heat and
24:30
coal
24:32
the continuing increase in carbon
24:34
emissions alone may drastically change
24:36
the world's climatic patterns
24:41
okay didn't attempt to go political here
24:44
but uh
24:47
let's see if you can find something else
24:48
interesting
24:54
3d flight oh i need to change
25:00
amount of colors
25:22
okay that was quite blocky
25:26
but uh all right
25:31
weather
25:36
hurricanes call typhoons in the pacific
25:38
and cyclones in the indian ocean
25:41
are massive low pressure storm systems
25:43
with spiraling winds
25:44
that can reach 180 miles per hour
25:47
hurricanes begin as tropical depressions
25:50
fueled by
25:51
warm equatorial seas as hot humid air
25:54
rises scattered thunderstorms form
25:56
that can join to create a central low
25:58
pressure area
25:59
the storms merge and circle this low
26:01
pressure eye gathering strength and
26:03
speed as they draw inward
26:05
to become a hurricane that is set
26:06
spinning by the earth's rotation
26:09
since hurricanes require a constant
26:11
source of warm wet air
26:13
they eventually lose strength and break
26:15
apart over land
26:17
because they are usually driven by the
26:19
trade winds the western regions of
26:21
oceans are at greatest risk of
26:22
hurricanes
26:24
the philippines have the highest rate at
26:26
nearly 20 a year
26:27
hurricanes are ranked on a scale from
26:29
one to five with winds ranging from a
26:32
minimal 74 miles per hour to
26:34
catastrophic
26:35
at over 155 each year
26:38
an alphabetical list is chosen that
26:40
alternates female and male names
26:42
the names are given in order as the
26:44
terrible storms emerge
26:50
normally
26:55
norway is rugged landscape
27:08
norway's geography is varied including a
27:10
southern region of temperate forest
27:12
a mountainous center and eastern tundra
27:14
its coastline is known for its fjords
27:17
long narrow and often deep inlets from
27:19
the sea between deep cliffs and slopes
27:25
some pronunciations here yes yes
27:31
and talk
Outro
27:40
well the video is nearing its end and
27:42
it's a shame that we don't have these
27:45
type of software on these boxes anymore
27:48
or i haven't checked if we actually do
27:50
have
27:51
the possibility to buy something like
27:53
this now but
27:54
i don't think so but there was something
27:57
magical about these
27:58
when i was a kid i had route 66.
28:02
and when i got that it kind of validated
28:04
my computer it wasn't just for games
28:06
anymore because i could tell my dad now
28:07
it's useful
28:08
i can look at the maps and stuff so
28:11
that's also a thing
28:13
but yeah also the animations music
28:17
pictures on the cd like this that was
28:19
magical for me
28:20
back in the day i like this one the most
28:23
of course
28:24
because it's it's space
28:28
nothing is more interesting than space i
28:30
would have loved to have this as a kid
28:32
and also it had some fun games and stuff
28:34
to do
28:35
instead of only listening and reading
28:39
so yeah i love this one
28:43
thank you so much for watching this
28:44
video i hope you did enjoy and i have a
28:46
question for you
28:47
because i was inspired by asmr when i
28:49
was
28:50
filming opening up the boxes here
28:52
because i wanted to give you
28:54
the experience of opening up the box
28:56
instead of me simply explaining it to
28:58
you what i'm doing
28:59
and i was wondering if you liked that or
29:01
not i tried to capture the sounds of
29:03
opening it up and taking out the
29:06
contents and
29:07
you know flipping the page and so on so
29:10
if you enjoyed that way of opening up a
29:12
box
29:12
that is a more inspired way or if you
29:15
want me to
29:16
do it the normal way instead please let
29:18
me know anyway
29:19
thank you so much for watching and i
29:20
hope you enjoyed and i hope to see you
29:22
next time
29:29
you

Exploring the Ancient World of CD-ROM Encyclopedias (Nostalgia Dive!)

a few weeks ago I saw a meme on Tik Tok
0:02
where a young girl asked what did you
0:04
guys used to do before you had access to
0:06
all of Mankind's information in the form
0:08
of the internet and there was a guy who
0:10
answered who said we basically just
0:13
didn't know stuff and he was kind of
0:15
right we didn't have access immediately
0:17
to information like we do today but we
0:20
did have encyclopedias and in the early
0:22
to mid '90s there was a big push for
0:25
multimedia titles and this is a medium
0:27
that suits encyclopedias extremely well
0:31
Microsoft released many many titles
0:33
under the Microsoft home brand and a
0:35
number of these titles were usually
0:37
included bundled with a PC now as I
0:39
recently restored my deck using the
0:42
system restore CD one of the titles was
0:44
Inc Carter 95 now I think most people
0:47
would have encountered incarta as part
0:48
of one of those bundles that came with
0:50
the PC but you could buy it as a
0:52
standalone product however I doubt many
0:55
people went out and bought it now encara
0:57
wasn't the first CD ROM based inyc
1:00
opedia the first time I ever experienced
1:02
a cdrom encyclopedia was the groia and
1:05
this was at Primary School on our
1:07
computers
1:10
there now the encyclopedia you're
1:12
probably familiar with is the branica
1:15
the way people obtained the encyclopedia
1:17
was usually via a knock at the door from
1:19
a Salesman Who You'd invite in for a
1:21
coffee in a chat and during that chat
1:23
he'd bring out one of the nice shiny
1:25
shiny encyclopedias extoling the virtues
1:27
of having all of this information all
1:30
for a low low monthly fee and you too
1:32
could have the entire encyclopedia
1:34
Botanica in your own home and that's
1:37
what my dad did one day there was a
1:39
knock at the door and we were given
1:41
several cardboard boxes not only did we
1:43
have the big black books but my dad also
1:45
purchas the child's encyclopedia with
1:47
hopes that we'd make use of it these
1:49
came in the form of smaller red books
1:52
however I wasn't really the reading type
1:54
and trying to get information out was a
1:56
bit cumbersome first of all you'd have
1:58
to find the index and then you'd have to
2:00
find the article then you'd have to find
2:03
the book and then you'd have to find the
2:05
page well if you've seen any of my
2:07
previous videos you know that I'm
2:09
famously impatient and I want access to
2:11
instant information that was one of the
2:14
things these new CD ROMs offered not
2:17
wanting to be left on the back foot in
2:18
this new age of multimedia branica
2:21
released their own CD ROM based
2:26
encyclopedia and it's these three titles
2:28
today we're going to be having a look at
2:30
incarta 95 groia and the bratan
2:34
encyclopedia right after this message
2:36
from PCB way our good friends over at

Encarta
3:00
this version of encara fits nicely on a
3:02
single CD and works well with the
3:04
four-speed cdrom drive in the
3:08
deck I'm going to start it using the
3:10
digital getting started program launcher
3:13
which I briefly demoed in a previous
3:14
video if you're interested in seeing
3:16
more it takes a few seconds to launch
3:18
and does some weird things with the
3:20
colors on the display but then the
3:22
splash screen opens and let that be
3:25
Justice for
3:26
[Music]
3:27
All let that be this for all that's one
3:31
small step for man you don't understand
3:34
Willie was a
3:35
Salesman say simply very simply with
3:40
hope good
3:46
morning now for those of you who are
3:49
lucky enough to use this back in the day
3:51
I'm sure there's a huge hit of nostalgia
3:53
for you there luckily you don't need to
3:55
listen to it each time you launch the
3:57
program however as it stops when you
3:58
click the enter button
4:00
by default incarta will remember the
4:02
last thing you looked at but will launch
4:04
the letter a article if you've not
4:06
opened incarta before there are several
4:09
ways to navigate around but for me I
4:11
used to use the fine button the most
4:14
what's handy is it allows you to quickly
4:16
find the article you want to read about
4:18
but conversely doesn't help if you're
4:19
unsure of spelling the search results
4:22
don't give any indication of what kind
4:24
of article you may find some are just
4:26
text While others have pictures
4:28
animations or even full mod video you
4:31
can refine your search by the use of the
4:33
five buttons in the find
4:35
window I still think even in this day
4:37
and age the interface of incar is
4:39
excellent it is of course Very skom
4:42
morphic but I think it adds to the charm
4:44
the display here is running at 640x 480
4:47
in 256 colors and of course we're not
4:50
going to be expecting to see any super
4:52
high resolution images or HD video there
4:55
is only after all so much space on a
4:58
CD if you want you can open the atlas
5:00
and see a map of the globe you can click
5:03
on a country and jump to the article or
5:05
drill down to find states and cities and
5:07
links and articles relating to them this
5:10
was preg Google Maps and allowed the
5:12
ability to travel the world from your
5:14
very own computer so here's where
5:16
traditional encyclopedias couldn't match
5:18
the CD ROM that is multimedia and the
5:21
media Gallery short books could have
5:24
photographs and illustrations but they
5:26
couldn't have music animations or video
5:28
the only other place I'd seen video was
5:30
on a TV and having it back on a computer
5:32
was really
5:37
[Music]
5:41
cool remember we just upgraded from an
5:44
LC 475 which struggled to play anything
5:47
back that wasn't postage stamp
5:52
size a familiar find window will show up
5:55
listing all of the multimedia items that
5:57
are on the CD here there are almost
6:00
7,200 the media pinpointer can be used
6:03
to further refine the results by
6:04
clicking on the media button and then
6:06
choosing the desired media type I'm
6:08
going to try to get on the B now we had
6:11
a good aliveness
6:20
[Applause]
6:22
test there are 29 videos available on
6:25
this Edition and later versions were
6:26
released over several CDs expanded the
6:29
number of media items
6:31
considerably the videos here are being
6:33
dithered which is why the background in
6:35
some have quite a lot of noise to them I
6:38
personally got a lot of use out of incar
6:40
and have fond memories of it and I think
6:42
Microsoft did a fantastic job it is
6:44
evident that this Innovative software
6:46
transformed how we access and interact
6:48
with information in an era before the
6:50
internet became ubiquitous incarta
6:52
brought knowledge directly into homes
6:54
making it accessible to anyone with a
6:56
computer we'll next look at groia which
6:59
before before they were purchased by the
7:00
Scholastic Corporation in 2000 were one
Groia
7:03
of the largest Publishers of General
7:07
encyclopedias there will be a lot of
7:08
comparisons between Encarta and Gia as
7:11
they're remarkably
7:19
similar one of the things here that Gia
7:21
takes advantage of is the newly
7:23
introduced autorun feature from Windows
7:25
95 you insert the CD and this appears
7:29
you click click run and you're ready to
7:30
go making it easier for those less
7:33
versed in
7:35
Computing it's noticeably slower at
7:37
launching than Inc Carter and leads to
7:39
some awkward silences whilst the CD ROM
7:41
furiously tries to load the application
7:44
you might expect having it locally
7:46
installed would help with this but it
7:48
doesn't there are some useful quick
7:50
tours and navigation help if you need
7:52
them or you could just YOLO it and click
7:54
the start button just as with Inc Carter
7:57
if you've never opened groia before it
7:59
takes you to the letter a article on
8:01
first launch I find the information in
8:03
here to be a bit more in depth and it's
8:05
nice to find the references at the
8:07
bottom of the article rather than hidden
8:08
behind a click the related articles
8:11
button being front and center is also a
8:13
nice touch however the interface to me
8:16
seems to lack the polished look and feel
8:18
that I'm used to but it does have more
8:20
or less the same features as in Carter
8:23
images are still relatively low
8:24
resolution and you'll need Apple's
8:26
QuickTime Player installed to allow
8:27
video playback
8:31
there is an included Atlas which
8:32
performs much in the same way as the
8:34
previous title does clicking on a place
8:37
zooms you in and then you're presented
8:38
with links to related articles to be
8:41
fair there are only so many ways to
8:43
present an encyclopedia not much room
8:45
for Innovation here although I suppose
8:47
having a computerized encyclopedia is an
8:50
innovation of
8:51
itself neither ENC Carter or groia have
8:54
the ability to obtain updates from the
8:56
internet so information was quickly out
8:58
of date the internet still wasn't
9:00
commonplace and even though lucky enough
9:02
to be online probably didn't have the
9:04
bandwidth for downloading images and
9:06
certainly not videos in any kind of
9:08
reasonable time frame no you had to wait
9:10
for next year's release and these things
9:12
were expensive when first released on CD
9:15
ROM in the early '90s groia typically
9:17
cost between $200 and $300 depending on
9:20
the version and any additional features
9:22
that's about $480 to $725 in today's
9:26
money when adjusted for inflation still
9:28
a hefty ch of change the gallery button
9:31
at the top of the page opens a search
9:33
window which works almost exactly the
9:35
same as in Carter you see a list of
9:37
multimedia assets with the icons to tell
9:39
you what they are and clicking on one
9:41
will show it in the right you can also
9:43
filter the asset by type and here we'll
9:46
set it to just videos and animation I'm
9:48
not sure how many are included but there
9:50
are quite a number the videos don't
9:53
autoplay but I do like the video
9:54
presenter window thingy that pops up
9:56
when a clip is chosen it's details like
9:59
this would have been lost on a younger
10:00
me but now I really
10:06
appreciate astronauts Neil Armstrong
10:09
Buzz Aldren and Michael Collins knew
10:11
that their Apollo mission was one with a
10:13
difference their destination was the
10:16
moon as Millions watched The Mighty
10:18
Saturn 5 Apollo 11 lifted
10:22
off both titles deliver a rich
10:25
Interactive Learning Experience by
10:27
blending text audio video and graphic
10:29
iics making it easier to absorb
10:31
information in an engaging way this
10:33
multimedia approach Sparks curiosity
10:36
keeps attention and makes learning feel
10:38
accessible offering a wealth of
10:40
knowledge without the usual effort of
10:42
hunting it down in short the dynamic
10:44
content holds interest long enough to
10:46
make learning enjoyable and effective
10:48
that's a long-winded way of saying the
10:50
shiny thing keeps me interested enough
10:52
to get the smart stuff into my brain
10:53
without me getting
10:57
bored the Titanic Queen of the Seas it
11:01
was the ship they called indestructible
11:03
on a moonless night during her maiden
11:05
voyage in 1912 the Titanic hit an
11:08
iceberg and went down the icy ocean
11:11
became a graveyard for500 passengers and
11:15
crew the 1990 Edition was the first to
11:18
feature pictures and the 1992 Edition
11:21
was the first to deliver video and sound
11:23
the last version of grer to be released
11:25
on CD ROM was in 2003 but before its
11:28
demise it was often included on magazine
11:30
cover CDs for free in an attempt to
11:32
increase its dwindling market share or
11:35
perhaps to help sell the magazine by
11:36
advertising included software worth
11:38
hundreds of pounds the information is
11:41
Now hidden behind a pay wall under the
11:43
Scholastic gobrand but the growly
11:45
encyclopedia should be remembered for
11:46
being a pioneering resource that
11:48
significantly shaped the way we access
11:50
and engage with
11:55
information so that brings us to
Britannia
11:57
britanica and oh dear
12:00
I think I must have erased this awful
12:01
experience entirely from every neuron in
12:03
my brain as it is without a doubt the
12:05
worst one out of the three of this Bunch
12:07
possibly the history of software ever
12:10
feel free to discuss in the comments the
12:13
first things first it launches a a
12:15
browser what in the world a a Netscape
12:19
oh boy this is going to be
12:21
interesting the interface is basically a
12:24
search window and rather than searching
12:26
using simple words you can ask it
12:27
phrases which it will success not return
12:29
anything useful you're looking for from
12:32
playing around I found that it basically
12:34
ignores words like the and and or which
12:37
are all sensible but what's the point in
12:39
asking for a phrase if you're just going
12:40
to search by word anyway oh and the
12:43
search button will always make a ding
12:45
and that in itself is super annoying
12:48
next we need to wait for the search to
12:49
search the index and then this creates a
12:52
page and ranks it that bit is clever and
12:55
fancy but it means it seems to take eons
12:57
to gather the results and I can see
12:59
teenage me losing the world to live
13:01
trying to use it I think my dad was
13:03
disappointed that it didn't get more use
13:05
and that's literally because it's so
13:06
awful I can see the advantage of making
13:09
it all in HTML as it would mean it might
13:11
make it easier to port to different
13:13
platforms but let the user choose their
13:14
own browser for goodness sakes when the
13:17
search results are back and you open up
13:19
an article most of them are
13:20
underwhelming and not very pretty it's
13:23
like the text equivalent of Death by
13:25
PowerPoint very few articles I've
13:27
searched for have any multimedia
13:28
elements to them several I found have
13:31
images that can be viewed but I haven't
13:33
seen any form of Animation or video and
13:35
that's despite this addition coming on
13:37
two CD
13:39
ROMs a saving grace are hyperlinks in
13:42
articles which take you to related pages
13:44
and thankfully these load much
13:46
faster the interface isn't much to write
13:48
home about and it's quite minimal there
13:51
are a number of tabs across the top and
13:53
the everpresent search box but aside
13:55
from that not much else clicking on
13:58
spectrum is sort of analogous to the
14:00
area of Interest menu in Encarta or the
14:02
guided tour section in groia and Compass
14:05
opens up some sort of map that I've not
14:07
explored much the whole thing is so
14:09
underwhelming I kind of lost interest
14:11
with it sadly the online Link no longer
14:14
works and we didn't have internet access
14:16
when we originally had this so I can't
14:17
talk of what services were available I
14:20
also don't think this would be money
14:21
while spent searching for something and
14:23
paying for the phone call whilst you're
14:25
reading whatever results are found now
14:27
for this kind of thing and for the time
14:29
frame we're talking about I think the CD
14:31
ROM approach was a better option so yeah
14:35
the less we talk about Banica the better
14:37
I don't see how britanica could have had
14:40
such a Monumental fail with a product
14:42
after being the physical book market
14:44
leader for years it feels like they
14:46
looked at all the possible ways of
14:47
making an application and decided to go
14:49
in the opposite direction to their
14:51
counterparts it's funny in a way because
14:53
groia introduced the first CD ROM
14:55
encyclopedia and bratan introduced the
14:57
first online encyclopedia in 19 94 you
15:00
could access this at eb.com and then
15:02
later britannica.com it proved so
15:05
popular that it fell over several times
15:07
by the sheer volume of people trying to
15:08
access it but its days were numbered in
15:11
2001 Wikipedia was released to the world
15:13
and that changed everything before you
15:16
had to rely on companies fact checking
15:17
their articles whereas Wikipedia relied
15:20
and still does to this day on public
15:22
editors there are strict rules that the
15:24
editors must follow but it may be that
15:26
the Articles cite unreliable sources so
15:29
even though for the most part the
15:30
information is accurate you should
15:31
always check your sources well I guess
15:34
the answer to the young girl's question
15:36
is we had encyclopedias and some of us
15:38
even had fancy digital ones of varying
15:40
quality that once we got back to our
15:42
house and booted our computer up and
15:44
then remembered the subject we wanted to
15:45
search on we might be able to find it on
15:47
the computer or if you didn't just like
15:50
go to a
15:51
library anyway thanks so much for
15:53
watching I hope you found this useful
15:55
and I look forward to seeing you in the
15:56
next one

The Wonder of CD-ROM - The '90s [Nostalgic Discharge] | Nostalgia Nerd

greetings I wanted to talk to you
0:04
quickly about something on my mind and
0:07
that is cd-rom-based media and how
0:11
exciting it was in the nineties I think
0:13
sometimes we forget how exciting these
0:16
things were back in those days before
0:19
the dawn of the cd-rom pretty much all
0:20
we had were things like this floppy
0:22
disks and tapes and you couldn't fit a
0:25
lot of programs on here you know I used
0:27
to go around my friend's house and try
0:28
and cram as many things onto a disk off
0:31
his computer but I think I might like to
0:33
play around with at home utilities and
0:35
games and little shareware things and
0:37
just cram as many onto a disk or maybe
0:40
pkzip them over several discs and then
0:42
go Haven look at this treasure trove
CDROM
0:44
but in the early 90s cd-rom landed and
0:47
people started talking about it on bad
0:49
influence and shows and consoles came
0:52
out like the CD 32 it was kind of a
0:54
must-have thing even though machines
0:56
like the CD 32 did he do anything extra
0:59
than other machines we just had more
1:01
storage space but it was about extra
1:03
storage space which was somehow
1:04
appealing I think I first really
1:06
experienced this with adverts in Amiga
1:09
Atari ST magazines with like massive
1:11
spreads of all the CD ROMs you could
1:13
order food to the brim of PD software
1:16
and images and sounds there's like a
1:19
little treasure trove on just one disk
1:21
and they were about 20 quid but in my
Whats on a CD
1:23
mind I could have got where those disks
1:25
and that would have been like a
1:26
lifetime's worth of searching it would
1:28
have been like Christmas Day every day
1:30
looking free about CD I mean nowadays
1:33
with the dawn on the Internet everything
1:35
is at our fingertips and there's a bit
1:36
too much yeah there's so much you don't
1:39
feel like going into it and having a
1:40
look at a specific thing because you
1:42
can't get through all of it boom a CD
1:44
that's what you had on that CD and I
1:46
would literally spend hours going
1:48
through that CD looking at all the
1:50
directories what was in their
1:51
directories even if a program didn't
1:53
work you'll sometimes have additional
1:55
executables which may be able to do
1:57
something it was just a goldmine of
1:59
things of programs of amazingness and
2:03
because of all the stuff we have now
2:05
just don't get that you just don't get
2:07
the chance to sit down with a cd-rom and
2:09
just find out what the hell is on it
My first CD
2:12
first I got a cd-rom
2:13
drive was in 96 I believe when I got a
2:16
creative labs quad speed drive from my
2:19
486 tx2 66 I mean that opened up a world
2:22
of magazines and cover discs and like
2:25
literally those loads on these cover
2:27
distally would I'd buy one at weekend my
2:30
paper route money and spending just
2:33
going through all the demos and stuff
2:34
like here we have Tomb Raider 2
2:38
Tarak fast formas 3 Jedi Knight it was
2:43
just 40 popular utilities what do they
2:46
do what can I do with my windows setup
2:48
how can i enhance it things like that
2:50
and look at this one though this is
2:53
jam-packed there's so many dword Xand
2:55
letters on there look at the back look
2:56
all the things you get on here be a
2:59
central PC to kick token top top utility
3:01
programs insects Suite 1 web talk cyber
3:05
Bud Light mech Wars bedlam cyber storm
3:08
FC to hinder draw plasters I work sites
3:14
goldmine and that excitement is just lot
3:17
that I'm missing this is my view videos
3:20
going through old discs I head it's just
3:22
fun to finding these programs I've long
3:24
forgotten about and finding out what
3:25
they do I'm gonna do a few videos where
3:27
I start going through cover discs like
3:29
this because these were just amazing and
3:32
I would buy more than one PC Magazine a
3:35
week if I could afford it just to get
3:39
the contents of these discs I mean it
3:40
might have been better for me just to
3:42
save my money and buy a proper game but
3:44
it just couldn't compare to just finding
3:47
out what was on these you know even when
3:50
we got DVDs DVDs started to get a bit
3:52
big that was a bit of a mission to go
3:55
through everything would be on a DVD CD
3:58
ROMs were just the right size for
3:59
exploration and that is a bit of a 90s a
4:02
bit of nostalgia that seems missing in
4:05
my life now I just wanted to share it
4:07
with you because maybe you felt the same
4:09
thing back when you first got a cd-rom
4:11
drive when you first got them eager with
4:13
a CD one more PC or whatever you had
4:15
anyway thanks for watching see you soon
4:20
you


Jerma Streams - 700,000 Games Version 2.0

0:01
hi guys welcome welcome
0:08
to stream that is going to be a little all over the place I
0:14
think this is going to be interesting you probably saw the title
0:19
already this is 700,000 games no it is not 700,000 games from a
0:27
couple years back or a year and a half whatever it was this is the sequel this is 700,000 games
0:36
to I'm not just playing the old one they did it
0:42
again they did it again they packed 700,000 more games
0:48
into this teeny tiny little disc how do they even get it in
0:55
there so they over the two versions have 1.4 million games
1:02
oh that coffee is very hot I'm going to let it sit there for a
1:07
minute yeah this is version two I've already gone through and looked at a few things and we'll touch upon them in just
1:16
a a matter of mere minutes so give me one second I want to
1:21
uh I want to grab another coaster so give me one sec be right
1:28
back
2:10
okay uh so if we take a look at the box I'm going to show the box
2:15
now because I want to have people be able to trickle in because this stream is a fairly special stream we're not
2:21
going to be doing this that often so and by often I mean you we're going until
2:26
this is done I'm going to play every single one like last
2:32
time if there's 700,000 games and I play each one for 5 minutes that's 7 1.4
2:41
million 23 for I got that's you're talking about probably three or four years of the stream is going to
2:47
be so this is probably going to be threee 20 a 24-hour threeyear long
2:58
stream so so I'll see you guys when I'm like 40 and we get to the last
3:04
one so uh without further Ado why don't we go like
3:09
this and why don't we go like this hi so here it is 700,000 Games
3:19
version 2.0 one of the things you're probably noticing right off the bat is the fact
3:25
that the uh the price tag has been scratched off I I didn't do that that came like
3:31
this and as we all know there are only two reasons why you do that uh either one the gift was so cheap that you
3:37
desperately don't want the person to know that it was a piece of or you're embarrassed because the gift was
3:43
too expensive and I wonder which one this
3:48
is Yeah scratch off that price tag know it's a gift I don't want you to
3:53
know how much this was both now can you no I don't know
4:00
maybe the company is embarrassed that this was like $11 on Amazon wherever the
4:05
hell it is but yeah uh here you go give you a
4:11
closeup that's you see pyramid Escape up there can't wait for that one uh mini golf 3D Mania something
4:19
interesting to note about 3D golf mini Mania uh there's a thousand And1 mini golf Mania levels which is included in a
4:26
game so that's a,1 different games they're using a weird semantic literal
4:31
definition and oddly enough that took about uh 40 minutes to
4:37
install something else that's kind of funny about this before we get started is I did open some of these and
4:45
why don't we just I'll just show you
4:51
uh it this is the same exact thing is the last one here's the
4:56
difference take a look at the here here are all of them
5:02
so you see those of you that watched the last the video that I did on the first version I had a lot of problems not
5:08
being able to open a lot of these so what this actually is this is not
5:13
700,000 games to this is 700,000 games but this time a bunch of them
5:20
work this is a patch they patched in the ability to open half the games you
5:27
couldn't open last time
5:34
sounds pretty good does doesn't it take a look we got hidden objects arcade games
5:43
brickbuster games time management games marble popper card Sports Match 3
5:50
puzzles look at all these boring terrible games that make up
5:58
699,000 on the one
6:03
dis so yeah that that's pretty much the long and short of it so what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to
6:09
do a little system here so I'm going to change this to this I thought about turning on Smart
6:18
click uh there is no way smart click is going to work you guys are going to have to
6:25
like pick a quadrant if I turn on smart click there's no way we will never
6:30
choose a game so we're just going to start we'll do smart click for like an encore at the
6:39
end pick quadrant then
6:44
game smart click I'm just curious of how awful this would be so hold on give me
6:49

29:04
actual all of the monitors are in like 640 by 480 all right look closely because I got
29:12
a up screen too I thought the Dick Tiger was really really happy that
29:17
he killed like a bunch of people I thought these were all like dead bodies lying around I don't know why I went to that immediately right that's what I
29:23
thought it was
29:28
I thought he was like looking
29:34
happy check the Nvidia control panel settings uh well what's happening is
29:43
it's I the same problem happened last time I played this where some of them just force you
29:49
it doesn't matter what you do the game physically cannot turn on unless the monitor is at 640x
29:56
480 remember these games these games were made in like 2 hours
30:02
each what happened and there's your case in
30:08
point this this game took 42 minutes to make and after that we're
30:16
out okay well that was
30:23
fun and I'm just I'm just going to get it out of the way
30:29
because oh Jesus this is still on we're I'm going to open up super mole right
30:38

33:59
it's not exciting but this is a good game yeah you don't die from that good oh I
34:05
have a health meter [Music] sick there's actual thought in this
34:14
[Music]
34:21
one that was fun
34:28
all right this is where it derails how long has it been cuz that's the first one that I think is still open
34:35
in the task manager and I if I close it it might kill the
34:42
whole computer
34:48
why no I think we're fine no we're good no we're good we're good we're good we're good everything's fine right I can I can still change scenes oh we're
34:55

35:03
mole and then we had the super Fox 2
35:09
right super Fox 2 was down here and we've played four
35:18

35:25
so where would you like to go next oh wonderful lovely audience of
35:42
mine we're in this together oh yes we are I'm seeing a lot of
35:49
uh it's more now that there's no more Super in the title seem to be pretty
35:55
evenly split except for fish food which is the next one we're going to play so
36:02
let's go ahead and open up fish food hopefully this one has even a full screen graphic
36:09
option that would be very
36:15
nice now I get to do the fun task of finding where the that game is okay
36:20
found it fish food let's go if you think this is going to be even
36:26
remote close to inan aquarium you are you are so wrong that it's actually
36:31

37:02
window when did this come out I'm hold on a minute let's be serious for one
37:07

37:13
Windows 7 and Windows 8 why would you have a 640x480 window in
37:19
like 2013 did you just hit the
37:27
Pinnacle of where you are able to design a video game and you just don't even attempt to go any
37:34
further this game came out probably in like did this come this year what's the copyright on it
37:42
2014 and you're still making 640 by 480 Windows you can't like fix this

41:53
death I this is going to this so long I want to see what happens when we get
41:59
to the nuke but the difficulty is going to ramp
42:04
up they don't want anyone completing the game because guess what there is no completing the game after level 16 there's nothing there it's that that's
42:10
just there it'll be a liar that didn't count I'm [Music] alive they didn't develop past like
42:17

45:09
stuff I'm not going to win I'm going to lose
45:15
[Music]

1:14:58
3.1 they just don't give a do they I by the I have no idea how to play this
1:15:04
I don't know what any of this is means I've never done it before I think maybe I think one time I watched my brother
1:15:09
played and you have to match symbols or something right match
1:15:21
tiles cuz and they're layer
1:15:29
so I got to find this I got to find these
1:15:43
two I'm going to wait for it until somebody figures out what I'm
1:15:49
doing just going to hang out here for a sec
1:16:06
oops oh yeah I was right you have to match them okay so get out of here get off the screen get out of here I don't
1:16:12

for no one's not here I'm just being silent right now I'm being so
1:18:00
quiet where right here no it has to be on the
1:18:05
edge got it sometimes you just figure out how
1:18:10
that you're really good at
1:18:18
something what that's on the edge
1:18:27
it's a nice interesting game so where are the 100 okay are there
1:18:33
100,000 pieces is this in
1:18:44
3D wait what this is so much easier to see
1:18:50
this this is 3D this is is 2D
1:19:00
apparently what did I just do let me like let me use my
1:19:12
finger hold on I go use my finger like I I sometimes I need to use my hands
1:19:17
because I got a touch screen here so so I'm going to make sure you guys can see what I'm doing
1:19:37

1:19:44
this one two three four 1 2 3 4 5 six these two those two
1:19:53
uh these two right there those two those two these two 6 7 8 9 10 11
1:19:59
12 okay uh I'm kind of stuck here though
1:20:04
because there's a couple of different ways to seven eight
1:20:10
nine okay yeah I get I can do really quick
1:20:15
math in my head
1:20:21
so green into green and then the red into red and then the black frame into the
1:20:28
green and then
1:20:45
okay okay that was that was kind of hard it was like touching the screen is like hard to
1:20:52
do then but I got it that was
1:20:59

1:21:21
games computer load up Celery Man
1:21:30
what you lost 300 viewers playing
1:21:38
mang well let's be honest here if you clicked on a live stream and a guy was
1:21:44
playing maang on it and it was on the screen for more than 10 seconds you'd
1:21:50
probably be like ah I I don't know if I want to watch a guy play mang and he'd
1:21:55
probably just leave all right where we going now what do you guys
1:22:08
think oh are we are we considering another 3D game that's guaranteed to either not work or crash OBS I'm looking
1:22:16
forward to
1:22:21
it
1:22:31
why does nobody like Adam [Laughter]
1:22:37
Ball Adam Ball there's the Pac-Man clone that one's from the last one too uh one vote is currently

1:24:01
stream not me not my face this I mean resolution scene detail
1:24:11
Shadows reflection cool effect if enabled if special effects is enabled 3D
1:24:17

appropriate didn't I learn my lesson the last time that I played this game
7:37:16
yeah but I thought we were going to get all all new
7:37:21
lessons I guess the one good thing about this is you guys can see in real time this is kind of a behind the scenes
7:37:28
video 3 years later cuz even though I got baited into
7:37:33
thinking this was the second one you guys get to see in real time how ridiculous and horrible this is
7:37:43
so live behind the scenes 3 years later video it's called version two not
7:37:50
700,000 Games 2 well version two what would what would why would they
7:37:55
need to release a whole another product if not to put different in
7:38:08
it for money but the 700,000 games exists
7:38:15
700,000 Games version two you got got to assume that there has to be a reason for
7:38:20
that version to
7:38:26
exist don't want to seem mean but it's kind of sad to think about past germa playing these alone and talking to
7:38:35

7:49:57
than I ever have in my life because of what my doctor believes to be IBS and OAB I feel useless vulnerable and like I
7:50:05
can't go anywhere without risking pain all the time I know you struggle with something similar in your Youth and I
7:50:10
was wondering if you had any advice from managing getting through embarrassing medical problems at a young age well
7:50:18
first of all sorry that you're going through that because it sucks second of all uh it is a it's a never-ending
7:50:26
process sometimes I've actually I've been I felt pretty good in the kind
7:50:33
of IBD department but I've been having some issues
7:50:39
recently but you just got to get a good doctor try to get a good doctor that gives a
7:50:45
and you just got to try to manage it with medicine sometimes you might have to
7:50:52
change your diet that was a big one for
7:51:01
me try to keep a positive outlook even though it's hard to
7:51:06
do I had a lot of problems I had I I I missed get togethers family events I
7:51:14
almost missed my sister's wedding because of of that I almost couldn't go or participate in my
7:51:21
sister's goddamn wedding so I know what it's like I know how that
7:51:29
feels uh but a couple years later maybe three years later four years later I started to feel better I was on a good
7:51:37
program started doing a different medical
7:51:44
procedure and I I'm still I'm still going and I feel better than I did
7:51:51
absolutely six seven eight years
7:51:58
ago just keep at it it's tough it really it sucks and I
7:52:06
wish there was some magic wand that I could wave to give you the answers and to tell you that you know or to get rid
7:52:13
of it I wish I could
7:52:22
I love how somebody just wrote yeah the Patriots honestly what conversation are you
7:52:31
having
7:52:41
what oh but yeah that's the best advice I can
7:52:48
give try to keep it's really easy to be negative and to fall into the negative
7:52:59
trap just try to balance your diet out and listen to your doctor and go
7:53:06

references no you guys can click the screen you know what you're
8:04:50
doing hey Ike Turtle thanks for the $1 you ever thought about doing board games with chat like a bunch of stuff
8:04:55
tonight's stream with the Connect 4 was pretty fun I think it would be Wicked rad to do other games against as well
8:05:01
also we can see how you cheat in other games as
8:05:08
well if there was a system in place where cuz it is it's actually really hard to do what we were doing cuz I have
8:05:14
to activate the extension let you guys vote turn it off and restart
8:05:22
it for every single time you guys could click on the screen so if there was a more streamlined way to do that I would
8:05:29
love to it's an interesting idea if there's

8:06:26
was placed if the first piece is placed on either end that player will lose if
8:06:33

8:09:51
years probably was Hulk Hogan into my late teens and teens and
8:09:58
probably 20s probably Jim Carrey I literally one of my favorite
8:10:03
comedic actors ever Jim Carry has influenced so much in
8:10:09
the world of Comedy that it's it's it's absolutely
8:10:14
unbelievable you go watch that string of Jim Carrey
8:10:21
9s movies holy they are they're
8:10:29
unmistakably some of the funniest movies you will ever
8:10:35
watch he's changed a lot right recently but remember he's like he's also gotten
8:10:42
older too he's gotten old he's in his like what his 50s almost his 60s
8:10:53
now it's hard to be to be Jim Carrey the funny guy he actually talks about
8:11:00
that in uh that Jim and Andy Netflix original it's worth a
8:11:11
watch He's 56 Truman Show is one of my my favorite movies of all time oh my God yeah
8:11:19
tourament show is
8:11:32
fantastic I mean do do I agree with literally everything he said in the last 10 years

8:12:29

8:12:44
that the French champagne has always been
8:12:49
celebrated for its Excellence but thank you for the heads
8:12:55
up thanks for the
8:13:01
warning thank you Razzle for the $1 hey germ sorry to keep you here longer but I don't it's fine we're just hanging out
8:13:07
but I just had a quick question you are so attentive plus concerned about the few that don't enjoy your streams how do
8:13:14
you deal with negative comments comments on your YouTube videos back in the day uh there's a YouTube link uh are you
8:13:21
linking to a are you linking to a comment here am I going to feel bad right now is this going to make me
8:13:30
sad uh it's it's it's it's somebody
8:13:38
vaping it was muted but it was a vape gnome it was a gnome Vape joke
8:13:47
I was muted so don't worry uh how do I how do I I'm concerned about the few people that don't enjoy the streams I
8:13:53
mean it's not necessarily I I don't think I don't think it's a concern about people not
8:14:00
enjoying the streams I think it's a it's more of a concern
8:14:06
of people thinking that the thing that they're watching is not worth watching like boring I mean like enjoying the
8:14:14
streams is is kind of a hard hard way to look at it because you can still enjoy something if
8:14:21
it is boring right there's plenty of things that I enjoy that are
8:14:32
boring so not enjoying the streams yeah but like there's plenty of things that are boring that you can still
8:14:42
enjoy I'm probably wording this in a in a stupid way but negative comments you
8:14:48
just have to take the opinion and somebody said it for a reason somebody said something somebody
8:14:55
didn't like something for a particular reason I get what you mean kind of well good it's also been 8 hours it I I I
8:15:02
need some spaghetti
8:15:08
so but you just kind of have to and my internet is like going through a problem right
8:15:14
now well we're good but yeah you just have to let negative comments if somebody
8:15:20
wants to be mean or negative actually and not just I know a lot of people joke around we go back and forth A lot of
8:15:25
times for fun but there's a big there's a big difference between mean and fun right like actually angry or like
8:15:33
hateful and I don't know how I can't change that person's opinion I'm not going to be able
8:15:39
to I told you guys this a couple days ago or or even like a couple weeks ago I
8:15:44
will never say like oh the haters no because that I'm not going to change
8:15:50
that person's mind so why antagonize them why why why try to tell them that they're
8:15:56
wrong I'm not going to change their mind if they don't think I'm funny if they don't think the streams are funny
8:16:02
what that's that's their opinion and they're absolutely entitled and have a right to have that
8:16:08
opinion I can't tell you that you that's wrong because I don't know your tastes I don't know what you think is interesting
8:16:15
I don't think this is I don't think you're very funny I don't think your streams are good uh well uh no you're
8:16:21
you're wrong I mean am I it's so
8:16:28
subjective so it's I I don't want to fight negative opinions because what what's the
8:16:40
point just people are going to have different opinions and just that's it
8:16:46
that's pretty much what I got to say hey p337 R thanks for the three bucks hey again germa J R ma will there
8:16:54

the emote that I truly truly am I'll be
right I'll be right back just going to grab one more thing hey only like 382,000 more games left to
play see you in a
moment
okay so I'm sitting here trying to clear my throat sinuses my my nasal
passages this Vegas air some of the cleanest in the
world no I I I kind of get this uh frog throat that after like an hour goes
away but yeah today the plan I could you know I could probably
today oh man I could probably do a pretty good Dutch right now with this kind of uh Vegas nose and Vegas throat
Arthur I've got a plan Arthur just stick to the plan and no not
deep enough and you
Arthur need to have a little F Arthur that wasn't
bad
he's making that face right now I make that face every single morning when I get
up that's the first image that you see when you see me in in
bed in fact that image was taken Kim took that
picture I got up we both sat up at the same time so I you know under Aker Rose
and made that face she snapped a picture and right after that I said oh
my back is killing
me in bed o wo why did I read that out
loud so who did the filter thing what what
filter what filter I don't know what you
mean I've never taken a photo with a filter in my life that's not real I want
to show people reality the real me no dog noses on this streamer I'll
tell you that much all right uh so here's what we're doing we're going to
do the rest of the 700,000 games last night got to a point where it was I was a little I was
kind of exhausted so we figured we' just close it out today and I'm not sure what's going to
happen after cuz this might actually take us like at least three maybe four
hours to do this so I this might be another full stream because there are a
lot left and then we can probably maybe take
the things that we were going to do afterwards and just do them another the time I never like to just rush into shit
you know I'd like to take my time like right now I've been live for 5
minutes and we're at the starting soon screen and the spaz just gave five
Community Subs coming in going boom dropping some Community set thank
you so much be my husband listens to you more than
me uh you you listening right now communication is so important in a
relationship listening to each other's needs and wants and making sure that you know you're both taken care of it's very
important
Rick germa never listens to
me all right all right that's enough of the intro screen what do you say here that okay look it looks like a lot of
x's but trust me it's not it isn't that may look like a lot of x's
but when you take the X's away we got like half the games here
it's an optical illusion speaking of optical illusions I want to make sure I bring this up before we go we even start
here um how do I look today no that's not what I that's not the thing that I
want to talk about but let's see how bad this is I'm going to look like such shit
let's find out ready you want to the big face reveal for
today not that bad what's wrong with the camera

on you look like Draco malth foil well my house is Slytherin does
that make sense let's let's make this
better no no no CU I don't like this because I
feel like I'm in a movie theater now let me let me ask you this is very very important before we get to before we get to the thing before
getting to the thing before getting to the thing I originally wanted to talk about does anybody else here hate going to the fucking movies during the day I
do I fucking despise it oh no yeah because the
lights it's like one o'clock in the afternoon a day movie hear me out on this one o'clock in the afternoon oh
yeah let's go see a movie you get in there and it's like oh yeah go it's like it's bright summertime Sunshine right
now it's like 95 degrees up let's get in that movie theater that was just the right
one here the whole I can't it's light out
right now so this is not this reference isn't going to work working I'm just going to have to describe it to you okay it's currently light out right now and
I'm turning the lights off in the room like it's going to do anything I I hate going to the movies when it's uh when it's light because you get in there and
it's pitch black and you have this beaming light in your face it's as if you're holding a fucking iPad in front of your face and then it's like for two
hours you come out you're like oh and it's like so bright you I
need to go to bed after a movie greasy hair no it's
shower I feel like it needs to be dark outside to see a
movie that's at anytime no at night at night it's it's it's the sky is is
Black coming out of a movie at 2 o' in the afternoon it's like it's like drinking during the
day like that that H uh-uh no it's like the same feeling I feel like I'm just
like I don't like any of this and the yeah the sky is black yeah
it is it's a scientific little Elon Musk uh thing for you the sky is scientific
is Tesla taught me that the sky is blue and
black he's stalling well I I'm not
stalling he's
stalling uh spaz gave another Community Subs you guys wouldn't believe how much
light actually fucks with you light gets inside and fucks with your
brain you know why it's it's so hard to fall asleep sometimes at night because you got that
light humans are all just made out of light you know you're 70%
light so which one are we going to
what would you guys say if you were to make a choice here and by choice I mean click on the
screen 14-year-old philosopher well not we're definitely not going to do uh
check uh I keep calling it Checkers oh I forgot yeah right the the
the optical illusion all right so here hear me out on this is for Real while you're voting can can I can I just see a
shitload of the germa old emote please and I want you to look at it when it's
next to other germa old emotes at least three or four of
them it looks like a different emote it changes the face changes it's a fucked
up optical illusion that I did not intend some of them are like smirking
some of them have a frown it's really weird
well that actually this is impossible because this to the chat is going way too
fast some of them look older than others all right how do I turn the chat
off for a second because I'll do it any mods know how to just turn off the
chat like can can I just turn the chat off for like two minutes or
something is there to do that is this does this do anything oh my
fucking God just scroll
up stream bans 3,000
people you can't stop
us well anyways okay when you have some free time just do the germa old emote a
shitload of times and look at them they they start moving they start talking they start talking to you I had a whole
conversation with three of them all right so we're going to distinct worlds I don't know what
that is distinct
worlds what's that what is it called robotic worlds okay cross your
finger let's hope it works it works now but it's going to be
an issue of hopefully I can even [Music] [Applause] [Music]
open that was fucking loud just give me a
second oh
yeah uh I have no idea I can't even see what what I'm
selecting what am I even clicking on I don't know what I just did it just
the music stopped that's all that happened I got to reopen this what the fuck all right no more
votes thank you for voting I appreciate the votes yeah I turned it off because it was just so loud and so
horrible but it's going to happen again so I'm going to go like this let's see if you guys can see
it let's try it again this time I'm going to have to not
move robotic worlds
incoming what that's it that's robotic worlds what a great
game it's
fantastic
okay that was robotic
worlds rigged uh oh there's nothing I can do
about that one thank you thanks for voting for it because it don't it don't
work H where where is this where am I robotic
worlds it seems like all the interesting ones just the ones that don't
work try again don't click on a red X don't click on a red X or it might blow
up the tiles around
it okay people are like in the uh got a
Riverboat got mermaid uh nasty
diamonds and there you know there's always going to be 10 to 15% of every
person that's going to click on Connect 4 even when explicitly told this my
favorite part even when explicitly told this is the human mind at work explicitly told that that I'm not going
to play it I'm not going to click that it's not going to happen going to do it
anyways nasty diamonds sounds like a strip
club chaotic neutral chat
no 50% how many how many fucking chaotic doofuses are in here right
now that's what I wonder well it's this one up here it's
uh aquamaria I don't know what that is let's see Aqua what's it called
aquamania awful stupid lawful stupid I that whole thing that was fun okay let's see if this one works
aquamania it it's opening it's closing
aquamania okay two in a row is strike three going to
happen let's strike to [Music] okay we really we're really picking
great ones and it's not even anybody's fault it's this video game's
fault I really am curious as to we have to keep an eye on which ones don't
work all right Aqua Aqua there it
is uh try again strike three ends the
stream no I just turned it
on I all I hear is a faint slap when that picture comes up JMA just play the
game I just tried I just tried to do two different
games all right we're going to do looks like a Riverboat riverboat
extreme Riverboat challenge or something whatever the hell it
is that is over there on that second pack all right
Riverboat I'm not going to do Connect Four extreme Riverboat
racing well it opens what a good sign
the question is can I get this in a [Music]
window all right you got me you you know you
oh what wait why you don't hold
on you don't have 1920 x 1080 but you have 2048 by 153
6 what resolutions are you even attempting
here what monitor size is this is this like a is this like a
vertical 28 in monitor I don't get
it run Riverboat again to change Resolute okay well let's run Riverboat
again 5x4 no that's like a 5x two
vertical river boat let's open it again let's see if this can hopefully it makes it better hopefully it's not just like a
fucking cube in the corner of your
screen are you trying to tell me that I made it
unopenable no fucking way
I made it I I've made the game unopenable by changing its
resolution I didn't do anything
why hold on let me like oh my God why is this
happening I'm going to have to go edit the I and file yeah if I don't does it even have
one oh my God this is fucking ridiculous okay what
the hell is this thing called river boat
challenge I'm shocked that this is three in a row here
this is not even on a list best game hits five and six it's not even here it
deleted itself when I changed the resolution yeah that's what happened the
game deleted its own folder when I changed its
resolution uh no there it is okay extreme it's extreme Riverboat racing not just
Riverboat racing okay here we go data
Graphics menu d3e no this is none of there's no
ini I there's nothing here no it's over I can't I can open it
in safe mode but this is a batch file I'm not double clicking a batch file oh what the fuck hold
on all right maybe okay what if I just run it in 640 by 430 I I can do
it okay I can run I can Force the game into 640 x 480 in the compatibility
tab let's see what
happens did it work
nope I don't understand what would be causing something like that that's such a that's such a specifically awful
bug that changing the resolution of the game makes the game no longer able to open
ever again even if you change it back holy shit this is
unbelievable I don't even know what to say can I
like did you hear that little laugh I'm going to be honest with you
here though I don't oh boy this joke again what which
one what did I do what did I
do I should just be a country singer by the amount of times my voice cracks
seriously bring back super
frog no ger is such a millennial I am a millennial oh I get what you're doing
you're doing like the reverse Boomer thing okay thanks all right we're going to go to uh Fantasy

good anybody else find it funny that every every single level going forward
the text gets smaller and smaller that was a huge bunch of stuff
to read and then it's like oh and a little bit one more problem to solve with the Fain is tireless you need to
release 25 Souls they had an elaborate the problem over the snowy mountain caps and through
the treacherous no I don't care
anymore
[Music] I like this one I unironically think
this game is fun really do that's weird to
say let me think about this I got a minute it's cuz you're a cas
maybe I uh this will be the last one I I'll do
this one off stream I'll play this one for like an
hour it's it's Candy Crush with upgrade [Music]
point here's the difference though Candy Crush is a total horseshit video game
and all of them all the iPad Match 3 games follow the same formula and that formula is the games are free to
download but after about 25 levels the levels become nearly impossible to
complete unless you buy their little booster upgrades to blow up a row that you could not get before so you have to
spend like a dollar per little axe that you can knock one of the splots out
with and every level after that is the same [Music]
way oh wear perfect mode hold [Music]
on like anybody actually cares that we're in perfect mode right now like I'm
going to look over here and see everybody going like oh nice wa cool
man I'm missing so many it's cuz I started
[Music]
talking loow up that's a fer right
there oh and it's a fer into a
four do another [Music]
four spring it
ah all right let's see what the text is like this time and I we'll move on after this one all right I two upgrade
points my magic book says you'll need to liberate 30 Souls but don't forget to use the magic gifts such as adding
time I have to stop I have to stop doing this
right you have initiated
you so the same color and then I get plus 1,500 that's a
lot of
[Music] points you have hundreds of games to
play that's true we can't get addicted to one of these what's this what does it want me to do
how do you match this one you just match in between
I all right this will be the we do have like another 150 games to play so this will be the last one that's it one
more time
slow nice there's a double uh Angel here

all right let's keep
going all right I I gotta pee every time the stream has been up
for two hours I have to pee I need to get a urinal in this room
and just mute the microphone and just go piss into the wall I wonder okay if I ever had a million
dollars I would install a urinal in the closet behind
me think about that think about how easy that would be so we're going to play Solitaire it looks like so thanks for
the votes but honest to God right imagine if there was in that closet
right there there was just a urinal and I could just slide it open and just go in there and just the whole back wall
would just be a porcelain and just all the way down and a giant drain in the bottom I could just piss
directly into the back of the closet it would be great or just the
floor if right here underneath me was just porcelain and just there was drain
I think we've already said this before yeah we have we have talked about
this imagine you could just piss directly into your floor and it would just go down into your
plumbing who wants to get up and walk down the
stairs that's revolting please stop what is what's revolting about going
P let's revolting a p is revolting
all right solitire it is spider gold solitire this is going to be fun because I don't have any idea how
to play this I don't know how to play soliter not a single
clue this is this image is fucking gonna haunt

[Music] back archaeological Museum Cancun Mexico
1935 graduate student Emily Jones didn't know what she was getting into when she accepted a summer position at the
catalog exhibits with the archaological museum in Cancun the heard the job
provided an opportunity to study some of the most amazing artifacts of the ancient cultures that had resided in the
land known now as Mexico while elbow deep in D paperwork She was drawn to a
mysterious Stone her edifice in the center of the Museum's Library ancient notes penned by a Spanish monk who had
served as a missionary to the AR tries mentioned a similar structure he claimed
it was a map pointing out to a secret Aztec city numerous Legends said that the city
was resting place of monaz Zuma's calendar a supernatural Relic that granted its possessor a long life the
monks notes said that sunstones that could be acquired in a game of magic 3es would show up on your iPad on a week toe
basis at least 10 of them a week but the stone construction bore no instructions for playing the game undaunted Miss
Jones searched for the museum for Clues to eventually found a Dusty box of colored tokens in a forgotten corner of
the repository noting that some of the tokens were adorned with gems the young woman began stealing them and got real
Rich real real fucking quick as each one of those gems is worth about £250,000
when she found the correct order the tokens disappeared though leaving the gems behind even more incredible new
tokens appeared in their place

died Mission failed the Earth is left without flies click here to that's good that's a
good thing FES are fucking horrible I'm glad that's good that they're
gone year 2009 April 38
Monday yeah the 38th day of April in 2009 that was real fucked up remember
that no fly with any insect dignity will ever forget this day yeah that was the
day when hordes of alien scum attacked our little green Planet these monstrous green freaks had harassed three
grasshoppers stolen spots from the ladybug's wings but most importantly
kidnapped all flies from planet Earth some say they took a bug with them but
that information was is later reputed by two stampedes that insist it was a bear
not a bug we can only guess uh this is a writing assignment
for a third grader this is what this is a writing assignment uh talk about give
a story of how the aliens came and took the bugs the British intelligence sources
have proved that the reason all flies were rewarded to the alien spacecraft is because their brains or lack thereof to
be exact the aliens wanted to know how flies manage to think without having this important neural organ so far the
aliens have performed one surgical brain removal to one of their own the experiment was deemed to be a failure
right now all flies from planet Earth are packed inside one gallon glass jugs and are hidden on five different plants
but flies called JN and H got lucky they managed to befriend the alien who had his brain removed he turned out to be a
real groovy dude and let flies out in the room next door John and Hans have
stump upon La model of the alien combat robot Hans turned out to be a great mechanic he got inside and start the
robot John who used to live near the Pilot's cafeteria before managed to
learn robot's navigation system they called their robot flybot now with such powerful weapon at
their Arsenal they rushed to save their fellow insects May the force be with
[Music] them

moved to distant lands many sages and magicians have tried in vain to master
L'Oreal's art since those times the shop is empty and does not please the visitors with magic Goods but it's

great pilot and had rented a light plane for a day trip how did he get caught up in the
storm I don't know he had access to the local weather report before he left by
the way do you know his company specializes in treasure hunting of course Grandpa loves stories about lost
treasure I want you to meet dick Robinson a germa character name his

you which treasure was Grandpa seeking when he disappeared My Last Quest ended in
Failure we spent a year looking for an empty tomb I bet Grandpa was upset he was
someone found the tomb and raided it right when we got there shortly before his appearance he
asked me to draw up his will according to this document if he dies the company is
yours I'm his only Heir correct however the will includes a condition you must
satisfy and I admit it's quite unusual that's just like Grandpa I'd be
surprised if all I needed to do was sign it you'll have a limited amount of time
in which to find the items mentioned in the will do you agree to its conditions
sure this is going to be fun if time runs out the company gets a new owner or is put up for
sale hey hey that's Fang he's from South America during one of my trips there he

person no there are two people to oh Gordon Jones I
presume yes my name is Richard Rosenberg I have a business proposal for you can
we talk in private sure let's go to my grandfather's uh I mean I mean to my
office as I said I have a business proposal in which you might be interested i' like to purchase your
grandfather's company um why didn't you approach my
grandfather with this proposal I approached your grandfather several times but didn't want to hear
anything about sounding his B I assume he had a reason for turning you down only his stubbornness had he
agreed he would have been living in a mansion right now but who knows where he
is what are you saying nothing I'm stating the facts now
will you excuse me I have urging business to attend to
how it go
uh he seemed to be very unpleasant person I'd rather step on a poisonous
snake then talk to him is he dangerous let me put it this way he tends to
engage in Foul Play and doo whatever he takes it does whatever it is to achieve his
goals who's that girl Catherine Queen she's the leading
treasure specialist in rosenberg's company by the way she's a professor of
archaeology she majored in ancient cultures and graduated with honors so that's who we're competing
against I have a rather tackless question to ask what did he said to his fral I said I think about it but now I
have a feeling he didn't tell me the H truth take my advice don't believe in a
single word he said said then I'll definitely say no at least until I figured out what this
whole treasure hunting thing is about besides where else could I find such an
exciting job glad to hear it m welcome
aboard he needs to be off the
screen the early visit the museum and collect all known information about the
ition oh nothing sometimes you can find very
useful things in mams let's start here
uh can we find any Treasures from the sunken ships in a museum of course not but we can find a
clue that will lead us to them I had a more romantic picture of what a treasure hunting would be
like I know the treasure map a spade and a chest full of gold a chest full of gold would be
perfect right about now what are you looking for anything that relates to the
archaeological Expedition and the sunken
ship pleas please please please do not touch the exhibits
C is a mam after all oh sorry about that I didn't mean any
harm please be careful some of these items are so fragile single touch can
damage them your the only problem with this museum
is doesn't allow anyone to use the exhibits for personal reasons that includes treasure
Hunters uh what do we do now we distract the guards using the fire
alarm how's that supposed to help they're instructed to evacuate all
visitors and leave the premises when the fire alarm goes off well we have to find a way to stay
in the museum so we could get lost in here there are so many nooks and
crannies I
know look at this look at the guy back
here um excuse me how do we get to the hall
where they keep the artifacts from Greece Str intends are right and and when you come to the end the hall that
will take you to prehistoric Expedition somebody asked
Gordon Gordon we can t look for anything in the museum as long as the attendant
is watching us let s activate the fire alarm to get rid of him help me search
for something that would help with
that all right let's go I why am I still in this

to take down as many armed opponents as possible to shoot an enemy use the mouse to position the Crosser over the enemy
and the left Mouse button to fire for each enemy you shoot you'll be rewarded 15 points but watch out the enemy shoots
back your health meter will decrease when you're hit every 30 enemies kill will progress you to the next level but be careful every time the level
progresses the enemies get a little bit smarter and the weap to get a bit stronger as you play you will encounter powerups Health packs and shields I'm
ready this such severe lag here on this
mouse am I walking forward you'd get an F in a game design
class if you fucking presented this
I can't do it anymore oh my God I deleted everything it's all right we can get right back into 200 2002

King you need to put a queen a Jack or a 10 it's got to go down in the line like
this so I don't have anything so I have to flip over here so so 10 n right 10
N8 then you can move this one over here so then I have now I need a seven
or I need a jack there's an eight that doesn't that didn't help me though I got a six here I
can go I can do five
six it it got you go down or up right and it's suits
match and can't you you can hold so I can go
King there's a seven I got my seven that's what I

what is a Crystal
[Music] Maze
[Music]
uh [Music]
[Music]
well I supposed was I supposed to put them into the the gold is that what it
was kakuro games don't know what kakuro
is wait what what did somebody say hold
on what did somebody say I'm seeing somebody being quoted and tell how funny that was what did you
say what did they
say [Music]
[Music]
for [Music]
I've actually seen those before and that they're interesting uh I mean like pick Ross or
GTFO as the kids say right I'm a big fan of pick
Ross Japanese
crosswords and I think I think we got ourselves exactly what I
wanted one two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 has to be the yeah this is pick cross
right here I can sit here all day and do this this is pick
Ross it's this I can't believe it this is great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 thir
the whole thing is 13 it's got to be at least the middle got to be in here too so this is
12 uh 12 it's kind of hard to gauge that 98 three that's the only one so we can
go like this uh there's two here so it's either
going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 111 12 that's exactly what it is so now we can
cross these out so uh I'll give you a quick little
rundown of how I I I I love these I do these all the time I had two of these
for the my Nintendo DS a long time ago so uh essentially pit crosses you make a picture and you're given a bunch of uh
numbers on the edges in the top and what you're supposed to do is whatever the number is on the left side that's how
many filled in squares are in this area here in this row it doesn't tell you where they just
12 of these are filled in hey 10 of these are filled in you have to figure out with logic and and your
mind where they go also you know why what what's going on with the eight and the two here what is what the heck is
this that means that there is a space between these two so for instance let's say the eight was here so 1 2 3 4 5 6 78
or because it's here let's just do this way let's say it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
this two has to be at least one space over that's what that
means so that means that there's a space sounds real oh it is real I this
is one of my favorite damn things in the world so uh 13 was was easy because it
was there are 13 spaces so it has to be
13 so where it gets tricky is so this is three so here's the thing cuz it's three here
it could be here or it could also be here there's really no way for me to
know that right this second because this row is also three so it would have to be let's say
if the three was this way it would have to be 1 two three which would fuck this whole row up so it is not there that is
not where that is I'm going to ahead and put in X right here because I know that this is just a three nothing else is
here besides a two and three is in the end so this whole side is
gone because it's two space and then three therefore there can't be anything
here so it's like mind sweeper but better yes way better in my opinion it's
actually kind of cool it is very cool some uh pit crosses are hundreds of of squares and they have
insanely elaborate it's not just oh a starfish it's like a whole
picture they're awesome but I mean I I don't I I want to
bore everybody and do it cuz I'll just sit
here no fun of love this sounds sweet it is so we've got five I'll I'll do it
fine so five this row has to have five and there are two here so uh
there's it's very possible this could be down here five cuz we got four but then space one two this might be part of the
eight so if this is part of the eight which it is I mean 1 2 3 4 5 6
78 it's going to it has to go this way has to because there I don't think there's
in any possible way that you could have the eight go this way without the two getting screwed up there it's really easy to count so
there's 13 spaces right one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 like they
have to be here at
least fill a random [Music]
Square so this is 12 but remember this is three down here so you have to be
careful five and then four this could be this could be the four it's definitely the
four three again this is just three we can Mark these nothing in here and nothing
here because it has to be either one way or the other so that we can keep deducing it's
all about deduction so that way 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2
3 4 5 six can't really tell at this moment
so I bet you it get it's going to go one two 3 4 five 6 Seven 8 nine 10 which
that would be the three there and it kind of makes sense I'm going to go for it so then this is three that has to be
a space uh three is actually the end so there has to be a space
[Music] here two in the top row so there can't
be anything there so we got three somewhere there's a
one so six therefore 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4
5 6 it's kind of tricky but I pretty sure you can go like this cuz that would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 six so they
have to be in the middle here somewhere so that means this is part of the eight as
well that looks good I don't know where the one is 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 very
possible this voted to play this game for one hour
[Music] what do full pick cross stream one day I
it would be fun to start off slow that would be kind of
fun nine six just depends cuz this six is part of the eight this is three one
two three space one two three not quite it has to be okay so yeah this has so there we go
there it is there's your six right there six is done I I like
how uh a lot of pit cross games when you actually fill a row or a column it will
gray out the number so you're not looking at it I I wish this did it too but Ian this is kind of one of a this is
one of the more Bare Bones pick cross games I've seen I mean I've seen quite a
few so again three uh we've got two positions here this could be four and
that would be 1 two 3 four five it could be like this
it might [Music] be what a gamer no this is just relaxing
stuff I just used to sit here and play these all the time so this is three and then two which
it could be one two here this feels like a
[Music] joke it's not it's not a joke so there
has to be two therefore now this is done so we just
marked this this is so
relaxing I at some point you have to make a good educated
guess so let's just say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 n I'm already kind of
pushing it three it would it's probably this
what is but it might be the bottom no but one two three four five six seven eight I don't know about
[Music] that what about over
here one and three and N9 and 12 8 and
[Music] two five and then well it could be here
because that would be 1 two 3 4 five and then one two three 4 let's see what that looks like
[Music]
therefore one two three four five six oh shit one one two 3 4 5 six 1 2 3 4 5
six all right all right all right hold on 1 two 3 4 five six
7 it has to be here that's nine 1 two 3 four five six 7 five
six starfish Jupiter but which way does this go
because it could go either [Music]
way it probably is well if you take a look at the
just got her in confused I'm just scking around you know here it is it can't go
this way there's no three can be here because there's no space so this is 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 has to be see the three this has to be three
either up here or down here there's no space that's [Music]
it which then we may have just got ourselves the [Music]
one the one might be here it's not that hard no it's it's not
that hard it just kind of takes a minute to look at [Music]
it peacock oh why did did Cox come in and uh delete some
[Music] frames three
two that's the case then one two three four five six seven
eight nine it's probably this I'm going to go for it if I'm wrong
I'm wrong cuz then that'll be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 I'll be wrong if I need to be which would then be one two one two three
space one two three let's see if that fuck anything up
one two three four five six seven eight one two three one two three let's just
see because then that lets that's one two three four five six seven eight
nine 10 11 12 that's it for
[Music] this there there's two somewhere
[Music] here
I think this comes out too because that it's it's the way the image looks here this look looks
correct so I I'm definitely going to need let's see cuz it no it has to be one two three four five 6 7 8 n uhoh
wait a minute here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 n something's
[Music] wrong I fucked
[Music]
up H restart I don't think I need to
restart that be 1 two three four five let's see if that
helps that's one two three four five six seven
[Music] eight one well that's
one it's a little janky over here but I can fix [Music]
it this might be no no I think that's correct might not
be it has to be there one two three four five six seven eight nine
[Music] right like that has to be
there but that do no ah is it though cuz then this would have to be down here one
2 3 4 five six 7 eight that's fucking
wrong I think that's I think the 3D column is
correct yeah it's it's the [Music]
perspective where's the [Music] two two would have to be like
here like
here the nine has eight filled now yeah I know I'm just trying to figure like how I fucked this
up if the nine can't be like that then the threes must be down there [Music]
yeah this is a bad version of this game no it's just kind of a sloppy
version it really I I really like it when you can actually see in real time the it helps with being able to see some
of them actually have it so you have like two x's you can do or One X you can actually screw
[Music] up threes yeah the threes aren't
[Music]
identical like that cuz then that would be 1 two 3 4 five 6 seven8 and then
space one two one two
three one two one two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 no that's not right it would have to
go I'm it's almost there it's almost done does the starfish goes like this
it's like legs come down like this one so almost like this is
[Music] wrong two three real C be filled with it
[Music] yeah second
three that would be one two three four five 6 Seven 8
nine these are easy yeah I know I haven't done them in a long time though
this is the first time I've done it in probably like a couple years
[Music] like [Music]
this and sometimes when I play these I mean I'm I'm obviously my I'm very fucking tired my brain is
like a little slow at the moment yeah I could I could do it if I
sat here I know I could and like I could do it but there it is I had it pretty close I
don't want to sit here for like another 20 minutes it's it was close I see right
here yeah I had this right the second time yeah it was down here this is what
was screwing me up I had it correct before oh
well but no seriously though I'll be completely honest P cross nanograms they
are they are a ton of fun and if you are like what the fuck are you guys even talking about uh you
can start out with like a a tiny Cube that is like this
big uh let's hold on can I go back select
puzzle as you see here right they get kind of
wild um I'm looking for one that's just just a tiny
one I can't F I can't do it sort by uh size that's kind of
annoying size 9 by 30 just looking for like a really small
one 10 by
20 10 by 10 is usually very very
easy 5x five is just is absolutely impossible to faill but it it teaches
you how to do it 25 by 10 that's not terrible 1 two
three four five six S I think this is yeah it's 20 by 20
so you could sit here and like here like watch
see do the house
tube and this this is very yeah and it's zoomed out too but you probably looking
at this like a that's kind of crappy looking it I guess it looks like a fish kind of there are some very very laab
especially the one for the DS was awesome if you search pick cross in
Google you can get a bunch of 5x five ones yeah they're a lot of fun highly
recommend they're good for just hanging out and hey there you go there's

least they have to work and if you're going to sell them it's if it's going to be on store shelves this you could buy
this game at like fucking Target a couple years ago I mean if like if half the games on
the disc don't work at least half the games work and make sure that they
work magic sphere was really good
um super frog always a
pleasure that's
it actually Jeremy each level is a game so there are way more than 700,000
games I like the idea I don't like the execution but I mean am I really giving
a rating to 700,000 games you can't it's Timeless it's a classic it's a classic
compilation of games that were made probably 20 years ago that somebody kept

for like 10 seconds uh hope you had fun with the 700,000 viruses by the way no they were
great it was a lot of fun it was a journey if people didn't think that

line and a little bit past it but I don't think I would stream Monster Hunter world again I got
everything I wanted out of it I think I put at least probably 70 to 100 hours
into the game something like that over the course of 3 4 weeks I thought it was
fun it was great but I'm not sure I would want to
go back and do it all over

not so I don't know I I I can't I can't just be like you know what here unbanned I don't I have no idea
what the context is so can you unban my

wild but Resident Evil 2 remaster yes I'm going to day one this will I'll be
I'll be one of the 500 million people streaming that game day one just seems like a lot of fun I love
Resident Evil 4 I love Resident Evil 5 and they're kind of doing that they're going back and remastering it in that
style except not really but kind of third person over the shoulder sure I'll
love it and the demo is already out that's true but I don't want to play it because I want to experience the whole
thing from start to finish and I think giving myself a 30-minute demo would
just tease me so but thank you and yes expect that on
day one golden foxy thanks for the $1 been a fan since 2012 I have something
important uh what what is it
you say there's something important and but you don't say what the important thing is is it the band

you missed it also add germa NG as an
emote FG wgw thanks for the $1 I wish some movie studio would just give you a budget and tell you to make whatever the
movie you want feel like that might be the funniest movie ever so I guess I'll put this dollar towards the live action
death and life of Harold Street St sludge
Foundation I mean I would if I had a million dollars or like $10 million to make a
movie I don't even know there's so many things that I would think would be fun to make I don't think I'd even want to
make a movie I think I just want to make a series of like 25 different videos and
just upload them I'm not sure a movie I there were too many things I'd like to do with that
money but thank you uh golden foxy thanks for the $1 do
you still have your PlayStation 2 yes I do it's currently in the ghost closet it's ready to go for another
night when it's deemed necessary hey Trotter thanks for the $1
saw this in chat a minute ago I thought I'd get your eyes on
it hey JMA I'm planning on proposing to my lady friend that I would love to have you officiate the wedding from me and my
loved one I'll pay for your licensing and we'll fly to
you is that is that legal
is that is that legal for me to do that officiate a wedding oh it would be
bad it would be bad I could stand in front of a 100,000 people and do a bit
but you put me in front of like a couple hundred of your closest friends and family members and I'm officiating your
wedding I'm going to turn
purple oh my my God I would I would I I would I would even know what to
do that makes it better oh my God imagine imagine
officiating a wedding we I don't I don't know really either one of the two
people we're getting the pre-recorded wedding joke scene
it's a perfect stream oh
god um well first of all let to answer
that I I would really need to really think about that the joke is you don't know
anyone a lot of wedding uh official ERS don't know the bridegroom
that would be so it would be so hard for me to do I could I could dress up in a clown
costume and fucking ride a tricycle across a stage and have 50,000 people in that crowd just pointing and laughing at
me but you give me like a Bible and stand there at the front with like a
bunch and like grandmas in the front row oh I it would that would be very
nervous
fly to you you come on you coming down to
Vegas we are Christians so it would to be in a church just want to give you a fair
warning uh
Vegas make sure like make sure old like Grandma Esther is aware that you're in like Las Vegas
that's fucking first of all like with all jokes aside that's that's really
really incredibly like humbling and grounding and that somebody would actually want me to do that if it's not
just like a joke if it's for real that is so I can't even fucking believe that
that is so that's so un it's equal parts
unbelievable and equal parts the word I want to say is is just
interesting lot people get married in Vegas not just shotgun weddings yeah I know I'm just kidding it
wrong now Grandma's love the
slots but seriously though if I mean if if that's for real then I would have to think about that and figure out how I'd
want to do that and I'd have to like muster up the courage to be able to do something like
that so at the moment I'm going I'm going to have to think about that but I'm going to have to kind of respectfully
decline just for the sake of I'm I don't know I don't
know if the wedding happens invite
chat waiting for the wedding stream in five
months thank you so much for that message even if it if it's not real then it's not real and we just spent about 10
15 straight minutes talking about it and if it
is then that's something I would really have to think
about I'm actually I'm absolutely floored that you would even want that to happen in the first
place uh thank you the Jewish bro for the $1 do you keep Kim up with your streams

emote I'm never going to have that as an emote just want everyone to be very

Adventures in Heaven 2 is not what I expected
[Laughter]
uh yeah greetings yeah
this is an lgr blurb about [Laughter] this cover art mainly um apparently
painted or something by john clark i don't know what the story is behind this cover it's
amazing i've seen it on ebay a couple different times now and i finally saw one of these come up for sale for a decent price in
portugal so i imported it it finally showed up this is adventures in heaven too
power games for dos and windows msb heaven cd-roms it's just a shareware compilation
probably no installation required just type cd menu but man everything about it confuses me
other than what it is i guess most significant bits adventures in heaven 2 cd-rom this disc contains the best and most
up-to-date collection of games for dawson windows assembled on cd-rom okay fine a new and improved
multimedia interface for dos and windows full mouse support and sound effects so i mean it's really talking up just
its interface alone plus games i mean it says it's got smash hits electroman from epic mega games
and doom from apogee which uh no doom was at one point going to be
released through apogee but did not it never happened it was just id software went off and did
it on their own but anyway wonderfully confusing in every possible way and i love how the categories apogee is a category epic is not
apparently i don't know maybe it is and it just doesn't show it sound blaster support is a category
unprotects is a category there's just no telling what this could
be look it's red on this side it's got black text on that side let's
just open it up like i said this has just been taunting me for years on ebay
so i knew i had to get it eventually
what does the cd look like oh rather underwhelming considering all of
the excellence going on externally adventures in heaven too most significant bits okay so here we go
uh lakewood ohio apparently is where they were based again i imported this from portugal i
don't i don't know how that happened no manual just a little jewel case insert going over
how to install it and looks like some disclaimers saying that yet to the best of our knowledge aha the
programs and demos included on the disk are public domain or shareware right maybe it's actually true on this
one and there's this little insert here for uh a registration card you don't see that very often for these
random shareware shovelware collections my goodness significant bits
cd-rom discs i gotta i want to find out more about this company apparently there's a catalog
anyway we're going to install this and see what it's like i mean come on now this has to be
amazing wow look at that it's actually a cool looking cd in the back
anyway adventures in heaven too
that guy's neck all right got the wood grain 46 going the cd in
the drive windows file manager look at all my cd drives
crazy cd changer all right we've got a bunch of files so it said to just run
cd menu.bat but i also see an installer dll vbx oh yeah all the classic stuff
you probably need for a lot of these let's see what's in here
okay well this is good it at least separates things
uh by os so you have dos and windows elf tree in its own thing here okay
same with this one i'm assuming this is like the menu system stuff but yeah it is at least oh good and
things are also separated into their own folders that are actually representing what they are
instead of uh like that expert software when we took a look at the ultimate game collection where everything was just a
a bunch of numbers for the folders that's super annoying when these compilations do that i guess let's just run the thing it said
to run
oh they they they stuck to the artwork oh mouse driver not found well this is
clearly a dos thing so i guess it's just not detecting it under windows here but man this is honestly an
impressive menu system considering i have to come back and run this under dos the installation okay so this is the
window stuff i guess hmm creates a program manager group called heaven cds with a possessive there if it
doesn't already exist add this cd to heaven cds program group oh and it copies the
library and control files those yeah those things we saw there to the windows system directory that's handy
[Laughter] somehow the icon is also amazing
they were on their game putting this together look at that look at that frankenstein's monster looking thing and
just as it just says adventures in heaven not two there is a one
uh with not nearly as good artwork let's see if this just opens the dos thing i'm assuming it's the same cd menu program no this is different
awesome huh well look at this did it say to do that
oh yeah if you wish to install programming modules required to win
okay so run cd menu if you're running dos games run this if you want to run windows
stuff so these are the windows wow the windows things that it offers
and they're separate which is awesome this is honestly way better put together than i thought it would be
a lot of these brag about having good stuff but look at this it doesn't maximize but whatever it's
got jewel thief that's all i care about uh one detective
when way out most of these i don't recognize that's kind of uh exciting of course a classic star trek
thing gold hunt wonder what that is and of course castle the winds
because of course there's so much stuff on here
so are these all windows things like air traffic
controller is kind of a classic dos thing but it's got vbx stuff
oh i do these i double clicked it i don't know if that okay nope nope this is of windows
it's a windows thing some uh like nice stock imagery back there
huh yeah because i'm definitely more familiar with like the dos air traffic controllers
there are multiple uh we're not going to play it because it's
not fun but there you go wow so i guess this yeah they said we got blitzer the tried and true
the always here if you got a windows you know shareware shovelware
compilation here it is always got blitzer
well all is all it's total jank
oh this game the weird memories involved it's not a
good game all right bratz for windows what is this
arcade series a fun game for the kids brats are many crying babies that just won't stop
crying you're armed with the most powerful milk bottle formula on this planet i mean we gotta play that
let's play a new game oh dear what are we doing this whack-a-mole for
babies whack a baby that sounds wrong uh it appears to be
5.52 registration fee [Laughter]
ah okay wow let's uh go full speed let's see
what that does and all the brats oh dear oh that's that's rough
whoops vaguely rugrats inspired art there kind of looked like
anyway yeah what in the heck hey got herman in the frocks dude classic oh divide by zero well
okay i just didn't like that for a second that's that's just what that is and i'm noticing i forgot to plug the sound back
in because i was reviewing this the other week uh i haven't used it since then so
i need to plug the sound in not that frogs has any sound but now let's load a maze
and pc speaker
anyway it's just boulder dash those terrifying sounds herman is now
dead yeah i did a video in this years ago uh yeah well i'm going to plug in the oh
dude slam i love this game plugging this out real quick
oh man i heard sounds because yeah these mini are supposed to have sound effects too they were bragging about it
i believe i actually do have a serial for this but i don't remember uh yeah slam this is a really i've
always enjoyed this it's just air hockey but okay there's no sound i need the sound the sound is cool
there we go but yeah you can like um you can change
the viewing angle look at that you got like this 3d ish thing going on i don't know i've always
been quite impressed with slam i usually play it 25 degrees and you can change all the colors of the
table like monochrome uh i believe you can completely
customize the table if you register it got opponent options anyway
ah wow i'm awful today that's just how it goes anyway that's slam i love this game
honestly oh there we go i knew there was some way
to do it so we want to make it like kind of classic air hockey table looking thing
yeah look at that anyway this is really cool man i i like this
this is a great little compilation despite or because of even more so uh the cover art dang if there is some
download for this i'll put it in the video description if it's on archive.org and if it's not on there i will add it because this is worth
it do i know you
what what was that do i know you oh why
is it talking to me oh dear
leave me alone oh no we have a snarky menu system you hear this
leave me alone
everything makes a sound how delightfully 90s
this is brilliant [Music]
oh this is this is awesome okay so that's the menu system for windows let's go into dos and run the
dos cd menu i believe right
oh [Applause] spectacular um
i still don't have a mouse i didn't turn the mouse driver on did i i did not
somebody needs to sample that that sounds fantastic okay [Applause]
oops what apparently switched directories so that is the menu system
folder there you even got the sounds in the dos menus
man and again they're holding to that artwork and i respect them for it okay the mouse isn't quite showing up right or maybe it is
and they just they just went with a a black box for a mouse cursor i'm going to assume
that is a bug so here we go look at this amusingly
the apogee category is an id software logo which is appropriate-ish for some of these
halloween hairy halloween they didn't put doom in here even though the back says uh it's got a doom
from apogee doom is under adventure
lash just chilly oh dear
uh oh i didn't mean to do that ah scunny yeah we got scunny
yeah there's a heavy number of uh typos deal the nearly warning
right um okay i'm trying to launch it
all right we have a refresh rate change
or maybe we did earlier and i didn't notice and if that's the case i apologize
[Music]
yeah it's scunny let's save some pizzas i haven't played
this in a long time not long enough
okay that was not the jump button
there it is up nope nope nope oh
well that's that let's see yeah i thought there was
supposed to be we got we got sound blaster put music on too uh
hard no instructions are spaces jump arrows move all just
drop bombs i thought i was pressing alt but noise was not dang it no i don't need another
story i i don't care daggum squirrel pizzas all right here we go
huh it didn't it didn't it didn't apply the sounds
how bothersome
uh
that's what i thought
i forgot how annoying this is to play i knew it wasn't good but holy crap
oh this is terrible and the sound blaster sound isn't even working probably because it's trying to run it
straight off the cd and it's not able to write anything i'm assuming in terms of configuration
stuff all right ah this is so cool though like overall
all right let's see what else is in here we got uh christmas lemmings cd man bipbop two balloon challenge
these are all heavy hitters as far as i'm concerned get all electroman or electro body as
it's listed there man there's a bunch of good stuff in here in terms of shareware uh
clap dude mutant space bats of doom is on here paratrooper bob the heck is that
i guess that's a solo software game i'm not familiar with yeah um msbod is something i
actually want to do a video on i've been wanting to do a video on it for like since before lgr honestly i've got an interesting kind of
story uh sort of surrounding that one scud attack dude
and i recently actually found a registered copy of mutant space bats of doom which is something i've been searching it's like a holy grail of holy
grails for me so uh you know
well i guess this is not gonna let me do
the mouse yep that's a thing
you had to restart there uh and sorry it keeps going back and forth between the refresh rates this is 60 and most
all the games are going to be at 70 because dos so if i forget my apologies anyway
so this is the classic board game selection that's kind of annoying whenever you
click the just somewhere in the scroll bar there just okay it just goes down one by one
by one like i'm gonna click here and then tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick instead of just moving
the whole thing honestly that's like my only complaint about this menu system so far because
otherwise with sound effects like that how can you complain right i mean
good grief an intriguing selection of just
demos well that's different let's go with fish yes
fish swimming all over your monitor can we view these like the final id
ideas yes we can look at that man again they thought of
everything this is genuinely good and i'm not being facetious at all
okay that is made for a slower cpu
try the turbo yeah even slower than that apparently
well fish
oh how i wish there was a button on my camera to quickly go between two distinctly
different refresh rates but gotta scroll through and somebody's texting me shut up go away i'm talking to no one right now
all right let's see what we got education we got animal quest that's all you need jurassic spelling
whoa uh game what is this oh yeah this is the
unprotects hints unprotected so i'm assuming
yeah what do they mean by unprotects exactly
i was going to say it almost seems like ways to get around things
yeah like this defeats document checks on hundreds of
games safe and easy to use even for novices all unlocks have been carefully tested so like getting around copy protection
that's what that's the only thing that came to mind when i you know read unprotects on the back of the cd
this is a purely informational display of the games that can be unlocked when you purchase the full universal never luck this is not a list
of games supported then what is this just it's a hypothetically
you can get around these that's intere this is like a cracking thing right yeah okay let's just run it let's see
what it does
what in the heck
bypass document checks no more manuals code wheels or key discounts yes just straight up getting around
copy protection fantastic ninety dollars plus six dollars shipping
and handling okay there's a business version for business software 180
i'm wondering if this is actually the program is just like an ad for the program you may only use it on software you have
purchased aha okay do i agree to obey these conditions i agree
to obey does not provide bbs things okay whatever
if anybody's used this before let me know i did not know this was a thing and it's amazing especially the fact that it
came on a cd like this oh dear wow
so what is it okay lhx for instance is one uh i i don't know if that's on
that's not i don't know if i have any games on here that haven't already been cracked
i usually just do it myself well this is uh
this is nuts honestly i i this is really cool garfield deluxe edition in garfield
88 okay this is one of the most intriguing things i've run across in a long time
and yeah the rest of this is like doom editors mostly something called shankenstein a
collection of six new episodes good grief for registered wolfenstein 3d users
yeah all kinds of maps some hint thingies map editors this is really cool dude
again i'm impressed by this collection of
things look at all the puzzles amazing
look at oxid dude what i never ever played this on a pc i'm
only familiar with the like the mac well there you go look at that left mouse button starts game f3
restarts five is quality sound oh
whoa sound blaster there we go
ah there's a green yay [Music]
so i'm assuming since we have two mouse buttons oh well
because yeah on a mac you press like the tab or something to yeah do that anyway
there's the blue [Music]
yay oh yeah so it is right mouse button okay
whoops anyway let's see what these are sims we got uh good old corncon 3d desert raid good sandstorm
rocket fighter i'm not familiar with that one familiar with all the other ones here we go there's the a traffic air traffic control thing that i was uh
thinking of earlier when we saw it under the windows well it said bad commander file name but it's still working
oh or not well anyway there is a dos version of air traffic controller um
little corn cob covered that before let's do sandstorm i haven't played that in a while
yeah it was like the the vga-ness of this game it's got that kind of
mixture of high-res and low res going on it's just missile command but you know
all right i don't remember which there was some weird little shareware company where i uh
first discovered this just like oh hey mvp software oh hey it's missile command oh hey this is kind
of an annoying game to play all right let's just quickly look through the rest of what's in here so
sports ah do you work dimensions man they are
just taking whatever the heck and sticking it on here you normally have to get that through gm
i mean i've got that like a physical copy of that it's another thing i've been meaning to do see what's under strategy ant run alpha
man dude again just like all time uh classics and heavy quotes
polo ball bolo adventures bolo box you gotta have all i'm sure pretty much everything from
solo software is in here somewhere right helios of course [Music]
that's a great sound effect there super brain eight what in the heck
columns vga like sega's columns look at all the word games
okay the definition of shareware also known as the covering our butts
section of the cd and then elf tree let's see what that is because we saw that uh folder on the cd
earlier
ah okay that's what i was thinking yeah it's like a norton commander-esque
thing but it looks a lot worse i don't know maybe it's good at least
it's i guess a freebie which uh lord commander was not even though like everybody shared it back in
the day so and lastly we have just other yeah i don't know randomness oh look at this
all of the fantastic artwork that is on all of their other discs
so everything is heaven with these guys look at all these things look at if you had any of these
back in the day or do now let me know font heaven clip art heaven
cookbook heaven the heck like how this one is not in heaven at all just educational software cooperative
nothing having about heaven about that although there is learning heaven i guess that's different
straight from the heaven heaven heaven heaven sure man
whatever all right so there's a lot of stuff going on here this is cool do i know you no
well that's it for uh that is it for this video see the options menu if there's anything
special or surprising in here that's just turning the sound on or off anyway that's it
adventures in heaven too y'all come back now somebody seriously needs to sample that into a song i think i'm gonna do that
now thanks for watching
[Music]

Young People Try Windows 98
- Finally,
the PC of my dreams.
Or it would've been in 1998.
That was the year that Google was founded,
the first module of the International Space Station
was launched
and Microsoft became the biggest company in the world
Propelled there, in part thanks to the success
of this operating system,
(dramatic music)
Windows 98.
That was so long ago
that many of our staff weren't even born yet,
let alone using computers.
So since this sucker still boots up,
and I wanna know what they think
of Windows in the 32-bit era,
we are gonna go for a little ride back in time,
but not before we take a ride
on this segue to our sponsor.
- Build Redux,
they make it easy to configure your new build
with support guides to help you along the way.
We're not all Linus.
They also offer competitive pricing
as compared to building a PC yourself.
So head to build redux.com/linus
and start your new build today.
About the PC
- Anthony has generously allowed us
to borrow scale once before
when we tried out some questionable game controllers
and we don't know the actual origins of this PC,
but the piece of paper on the front gives us
a pretty good hint at its history.
We suspect, though we have no way of going for sure,
that it worked for decades in an offline environment
likely exclusively running the software
for a weigh station for trucks next to the highway,
or waste at a landfill before being retired.
That's all speculation, though.
As whatever software was once on here is now long gone
leaving only the OS.
This particular Windows 98 installation
is not an entirely fresh out-of-the-box experience.
Some software had to be installed
for the joysticks and USB didn't work
without first burning drivers onto a CD,
but it's otherwise good old Windows 98 exactly as I-
or at least as I think- I remember it.
All that remains, then, is to see
how quickly our whipper snappers adjust
to an operating system whose exciting selling features
included things like support for DVD playback,
multiple monitors, and the FAT32 filesystem.
- FAT32.
The Contestants
- I'm gonna be awesome at this.
My elementary school ran Windows 98
until like grade six, I think,
and then we upgraded to like Windows 7.
It was like, whoa!
(Jake laughing)
This is quite the upgrade.
- I think my first Windows was-
7.
Yeah. I didn't start using computer
til I was like 10, 12 or whatever.
- So I was two months old
when this operating system got released.
Windows XP was my first system, so.
Back in the day, this was my daily driver,
Windows 98 SE.
I spent a lot of my life using Windows 98 SE and Windows 95.
All of my schools had Windows 95 or 98.
I did pretty much everything
that you would normally do with a computer on Windows 98.
Man, is it clunky today?
Like I can't right click the task bar
to get task manager.
I can't right click the start menu to get anything.
It's just very bare bones.
There's something charming about that.
- Man. I swear this runs better than like Windows 11.
It's so responsive, honestly, like.
- Okay. Alright.
So, oh man, look at that lag.
Ooh,
Ooh.
You can actually change that.
Oh, oh, menu animation. Yes. Yes.
There you go. Now it pops up.
- Windows update! Holy (beep)
Is it just as bad as it used to be?
- I don't know. This kind looks pretty cool to me.
That whole vapor wave wave kind came in.
Vapor wave wave vapor?
- Man, network neighborhood.
The amount of time I spent fighting
with this back in, more the XP days.
You know, you'd click entire network
and it just, it wouldn't be there,
and you'd go into all the different settings for it
and try and get file sharing working.
It never freaking worked properly.
My Briefcase
- My Briefcase. Okay.
No clue. That's not in any of the Windows that I've tried.
- Given that it says Briefcase,
I assume it has something to do with files.
Can I open it or no?
- I was gonna say files,
but there's a My Documents thing right there.
I don't know, important files, maybe?
- Yeah. Okay, I remember opening this, reading this,
and being like whoa and never touching it.
(Jake laughing)
Not understanding what this did at all.
- When I was a kid and I was like using Windows 95,
I accidentally like dragged My Briefcase
into the recycling bin and I was like, oh crap!
I just broke something.
- Contains files you wanna work on
at a different computer.
Oh!
- That was for syncing with PDAs
and other things that you could pull out
from your computer and then take along with you.
So like you'd have a personal digital assistant,
like a small little computer or a handheld device.
- So you put files in here,
it saves onto whatever floppy disk you have?
- You'd have files that you could drag
into your Briefcase and they'd be synced
to your device for the next time that you'd left.
And then when you came back,
they'd be synced back into your computer.
- I guess that's why it's called Briefcase.
It's kind of cool.
Who uses briefcases though?
That's a real question.
Is that a 90s thing or do people still have briefcases?
I don't know.
- I never used it. Not a single time.
I would use a floppy disk to transfer my files
until I was in grade eight
and my friend Tiger brought me my first USB thumb drive.
It was 16 megabytes,
not gigabytes.
So it could only hold about
four times the amount of a floppy diskette.
I just had to install drivers for it
on the library computers all the time,
because they would wipe every time you used them.
So I had to redo it every time.
All right, what's next?
- Flashy desktop background. Come on.
Change the background
I know this.
- I know this.
- Okay, this is how you change your background.
I see. All right.
- Oh, this is easy.
I remember being in an elementary school.
They didn't have the software to lock this stuff out.
We would change the backgrounds
on all the computers and play with the screen savers,
so you had the little pipes going,
- Oh, you can change the color!
Let's make it something stupid.
(Emily laughing)
- Oh my God. I remember these.
Oh, they're all so awful.
Here, let's do clouds
and I want it stretched. There we go.
Yeah. Look at that. That's easy.
(Jake laughing)
- There we go.
(Emily laughing) That's horrible.
You can change the size of the font. Oh man.
- Red blocks. Pinstripe. Sandstone. Ooh.
Is that flashy enough for you?
Or do you want flashier?
- I definitely had a bubbles background at some point.
(man laughing)
- What?!
- Let's turn on Active Desktop. Why not?
Active Desktop's really weird.
It's always been kind of a crap shoot.
What we're looking at here is actually a webpage.
I can copy this link here.
I can click on it and it'll open a webpage
that no longer exists and we can add stuff to it,
like widgets and stuff.
- [Active Desktop Narrator] You can have weather,
traffic reports, news, and any other webpage data
at your fingertips.
- You could actually set it up with like a full webpage
that you built yourself.
I did that once. Had habit of crashing alo-
(video glitching)
- Please tell me we have After Dark.
Where's my toasters?
After Dark had the Flying Toasters. Yeah.
- 3D pipes? Yeah, there we go.
We would just sit there
and like watch it fill the whole screen.
(Jake laughing)
Hours of entertainment for like an 11 year old Jake.
- Yeah, I like that.
- Now there's a multicolor one. Hold on a second.
Did that come later?
You can do multiple pipes.
They might just be different colors.
Yeah, there they are. Yes!
I remember this being a lot cooler.
- That's actually faster.
I like that better than like going all the way
into your settings and like changing it.
- Why don't they have these features on modern computers?
This is so much fun.
- Audio recording.
Yeah. There's a sound recorder program.
Record your Voice
- Oh right. There's no search. Ay oh!
- Accessories. Yeah.
Communications.
- Uhmm.
- Nope.
- [Jake] Entertainment
- [Arthur] Dial-Up?
- [Jake] Can you record in Windows Media Player?
- What's Dial-Up?
- Virtual sound canvas? Okay. This has gotta be it here.
It-mm mm. No.
(Arthur making computer sounds)
(Jake laughing)
- No, I don't want to get stumped.
Sound recorder. There it is. Jesus Christ.
I looked at it earlier and I totally missed it.
- Sound recorder. Yay.
I did it. Okay.
- Yeah, here it is. Man, I'm good.
- This application. So much time spent in it.
It's the default wave file player in Windows 98.
All right, here we go.
- This microphone doesn't seem like it's from '98.
- This looks a little advanced. I'm not gonna lie.
Hello? Okay, but we gotta create a voice recording.
Is that right?
- That's weird. Oh yeah, it shows up a little bit.
I think I just have to talk really loudly.
(Emily laughing with distorted audio)
- We on Windows 98. I'm feeling so great.
- High anonymous writer, who set up this video, you suck!
- This is probably going to sound like absolute ass.
Now the thing about sound recorder
is that it limits you in terms of
how long your sound recording can be
because it asks you how long it will be.
So once I hit the 60.75 second mark,
it'll no longer be recording
and I'll have to play it back and listen to my voice
in a very scratchy and honestly, probably very quiet manner.
- Oh, it's really bad. Let's try it reversed.
(distorted audio playing)
Okay. That sounds awful.
- At least you get audio
and you get a nice little update of the wave form
as you're going through with sound recorder.
- [Emily] I can't read this. I changed all the colors.
- Cool. Don't wave.
That's gonna be a big file. We gotta compress that.
- Man. I still know how to use this!
Play it through the front jack. Well.
- See, you said CD drive
Plug in Headphones
and I thought I was getting familiar with this,
and then you said plug in the headphones
to the CD drive and you've lost me already.
- I don't think I ever actually tried
to use the three and a half millimeter jack
on the front of the optical drive.
- It's not playing through these.
- [Linus] Now, hot changing my audio device
probably won't work.
- Is the CD already in here or?
- And my sound settings just went away.
(Linus laughing)
- [Jake] Oh, playback digital or analog?
Use error correction. Hmm. Speakers.
- Do I have to go to a different program
to actually listen to it? What's going on here?
- This is definitely like more tedious than it would be
on a modern operating system.
- [Linus] Multimedia.
- Devices?
- It has to be in here.
- What even is this? A wind groove?
- [Arthur] Okay. So, not Windows Media Player.
Volume control?
- Oh my God. My audio thing went away.
It's not down there anymore. Did I break it?
- Oh! CD player! Let's go! Okay.
- Ohhhhh.
Crap. I even saw it in there.
- Haha! Yeah
That makes sense. All right.
- This drive is in use.
Okay. Get outta here, Windows Media Player.
- [Emily] That actually sounds pretty good.
- Oh, this is kind of hard.
- [Emily] I like it.
- I'm messing with this!
- You and me, baby.
- Uh.
- Mm. This is a sick groove.
Man, they just have so much control
and it's like immediately available.
It all just works. This doesn't work actually, but-
(Jake laughing)
- This is not front panel audio in the traditional sense.
What that is is dedicated to the CD-ROM drive.
So it's obviously on the CD-ROM drive
because the way CD-ROM drives worked for audio
is that you had little cable
that came off of the CD-ROM drive
that went into your sound card
that either piped out analog or digital audio,
because Windows just couldn't do like digital extraction
or at least not all drives could do digital extraction
back in the day.
Yeah. That's just how that worked.
So it's smart enough to know.
I never used that functionality
and I feel like a lot of people didn't
because it went away very quickly, but yeah.
Old tech, man.
- No one could figure that out?
How is that hard?
- Okay. What else do I gotta do here?
- Oh, where do you check your system specs?
Goodness gracious me, hold on.
Find the System Specs
No, I know how to do this
- Settings.
Control panel. That seems right.
- Of course, I changed all the colors.
So now this is just horrible.
- Task manager, right?
Is that even a thing on these? I don't remember.
I feel like yes.
- Printer, regional settings, sound system.
Telephone. What the, what is that?
Oh my gosh. You can make calls on this thing!
That's wild.
- Ah, pa pa pa pa.
System. There it is. Yes.
Wait, the CPU's not in here. Crap.
- [Arthur] How is it not system?!
- 256 Megabytes of RAM.
I love it.
- [Linus] That tells me we gotta be at least Pentium II era.
Pentium II. There it is.
- To find out the hardware specs of this PC
completely within the operating system
without opening it up.
You'd think that you just go to device manager here,
which would help, but it's not gonna show you everything.
Like the processor's not here.
We've got the network adapters.
We've got the monitor.
- I have a CD Rewriter. Fancy.
You want me to find the CPU megahertz?
No. Dr. Watson was some kind of utility
that I remember using at some point
for diagnosing something, but if I recall correctly,
it was not actually included in the base operating system.
So that's probably why it didn't come up with anything.
- Accessories system tools, hardware info utility,
which I believe is still part of Windows.
Believe it or not. MS Info 32. I believe.
- Oh, Genuine Intel Celeron Processor.
256 megabytes of RAM.
Wow.
- Windows Manage Swap File
with a, I guess a 6.4 gig hard drive.
- Am I just dumb? Yeah, probably.
(Arthur laughing)
I would love a hint.
- The writer for this project also suggested.
- [Background Voice] Top row, DirectX.
- [Jake] DirectX, maybe
- [Anthony] DxDiag.
- You, I didn't want you to tell me.
I was actually going to guess that.
- Which you can still run today.
- Celeron MMX.
Oh, I gotta wait for it to load. Ah, I see.
- Not that anybody actually uses it anymore.
- Oh God. It's so frozen.
- Crucially for us, it tells us that.
- Okay, we're running an Intel-
(Arthur stuttering)
- Celeron, ew
- Geez, I've seen this word so many times,
but I do not know how to pronounce it.
- [Linus] Hope it's one of the cool ones, like a 300A.
- [Arthur] 330 megahertz?
- That's pretty small, pretty slow.
(Emily laughing)
I don't know much, but I know that.
- This is a troubleshooting step that you'd go through.
Anytime you had trouble with a game,
they'd ask you to run DxDiag,
and then save it, and send them the dump.
I don't remember how we even sent dumps back then.
Maybe email, I guess as an attachment.
I have a RAGE II AGP GPU! Mm.
- Yes. This is a RAGE IIC.
The RAGE series is so weird to me
cause like they changed the naming scheme so many times.
This came out before the first GeForce,
before the first Radion, at least.
- All right. What's next?
Real time hardware monitor.
- Oh yeah, we can monitor our system.
That's task manager, no? Control-alt-delete.
Oh, that is not it.
Monitor Performance
- See anything I actually had to do back then.
No problem. Stuff I didn't do,
big problem.
- Device manager. Performance. Yes.
- Now this Tweak UI thing, this I never saw back in the day.
So maybe there's something in here.
- No. Resource meter! That seems right.
- There it is.
I did good.
I mean, it's not a great performance monitor,
but it's there.
- That's monitoring our system right here, on a monitor.
- [Linus] Okay. There we go.
This is the very early version of our modern task manager.
- So our file system,
we can see the amount of data being read or written to,
memory manager, how much memory is allocated.
And we can see that that caused the CPU
to work a little bit to show that.
Oh yeah! You can connect to another computer
to log that computer's information.
Yeah. This is actually pretty useful.
Seldomly used because you weren't multitasking that much
because Windows 98 was unstable.
- [Emily] What is any of this?
- [Background Voice] That one works!
- I only play the real games here.
Play Games
- [Background Voice] Hey, that's how I used
to play Solitaire, too.
It's gotta click somewhere right?
Games. Okay. (Arthur gasps) CIV 2.
I'm with it.
Wait an illegal operation?
Wait, keep Dennis here. We're gonna play CIV.
Yeah, we're really living the retro life here.
GDI resources. I do not know what a GDI is.
- I know you need more deep background,
but we're up against it.
- If only I could get to the task bar.
It's a barrier. It's stopping me.
I've probably clicked like a hundred times
on a frozen screen,
and I know clicking on a frozen screen does nothing,
but make it worse.
- [Emily] I assume it's a rungame.exe.
- Oh, I love Command & Conquer.
This is probably going to be the MS-DOS version.
Yeah, that's a DOS window there.
DOS games don't have any concept of drivers
or in fact they do, the problem is the drivers
are on the game developer.
So, in order for any kind of anything to work,
we need to set it up first.
This setup actually has a pretty good sound card selection.
Sometimes they could auto detect,
but a lot of the time you had to choose.
Now, none of these say crystal,
but the crystal card is supported
via Soundblaster Pro or Pro 2.
So I'm gonna go ahead and hit enter on that.
Now we can run the game and we'll actually get audio.
- Oh, oh, we're in the game!
Command & Conquer. I've heard of that game,
but I've never really played it.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah. Sorry for your loss. I ain't reading all that.
- [Anthony] Command & Conquer's so good.
- [Emily] I don't know what I'm doing.
Am I the boat? What's happening?
- [Arthur] Okay. Wait, wait, wait. What's going on here?
- I don't really need the barracks,
but if I build it there
- It's RTS, I'm guessing.
- Something's being blown up.
I don't know if it's me or if it's something else.
- [Anthony] I should probably wait
for the Humvees to get in.
- [Emily] Wait. There's more people.
- Wait, who are that?
Oh, those are my guys. Okay.
Let's go team.
- Don't want any damage on my-
Oh, I got a little bit of damage on my humvee.
No I didn't. Cool.
- Whoa. That moves. What is that?
Wow, they really just throw you in here
with like no explanations.
- Intelligence is still coming in,
so we can't tell you a lot.
- [Emily] Everything's just like a pixelated blob.
- Yeah. So this is like 320x200.
Good old Westwood.
EA did an EA and killed them.
- Ooh, this looks fun.
Okay. I'm super down.
Single player game. Here we go, boys.
- I used to love these kind of
3D blow-everything-up video games.
Terminal velocity is a pretty good one.
- I wanted to play Quake. So I'm kind of disappointed.
- This is kind of wild, you know,
cause I couldn't afford to play 3D games
back when they were in their early stages like this.
This compared to the games that I had to play.
This is awesome.
It reminds me of this game that I would play at school
on the Macs called, I think it was like Spector.
Vector, vector! It was called Vector.
It was fricking awesome. Wire-framed tanks.
- Oh it's running way too fast.
Unless this is supposed to be this fast
on the battle cycle.
- Many of these early games actually had their physics
tied to the CPU clock speed.
So there were some games that I would play
on our old Windows 3.1 machine.
And then I would try to play again,
once we upgraded, that simply weren't playable anymore
because they would run far too fast.
And I'm told this is actually one of those games.
- Yeah. It's like speeding up and slowing down
depending on what's on screen.
Oh rocket ammo, I've got rockets?
Oh, alt is rockets. Okay, cool
- Rocket launchers. Boom.
Yeah. Get kaboomed.
(Jake making rocket noises)
Kaboom.
This is actually kind of fun.
- [Emily] This is way better than that other game.
- [Jake] I wish this Heads Up display
wasn't taking up like 60% of the screen.
- [Anthony] You can see how the textures
are kind of warping.
- Wow. The scale's pretty messed up.
Stuff looks real far away from you on the mini map
and then it turns out it is very close.
- [Jake] The terrain is kind of cruddy.
- This is from the days back when 3D
was still kind of new
and how exactly you should render textures
in relation to the camera at any given point in time,
wasn't entirely a hard and fast thing yet.
Doing it correctly, as we do it now, costs a lot
in terms of computational power.
- Oh my God. Except I don't know where the walls are.
They just appear right in front of you and then you die.
- This is an interesting experience
and that fog drawing is pretty interesting as well.
It's like dithering,
whereas usually you'd get like a banding effect instead.
- It's hard to gauge if you can actually
drive over something.
Oh and I'm dead. All right.
- If you flip over you die. What is that?
That's not fair.
(Linus making fighting noises)
- That was not bad.
Not bad for first run.
- [Linus] Man. I would've played the crap out of this.
- I wanna play internet games.
THE INTERNET
Did I get the internet working?
Hold on. Holy (beep) it works.
Okay. This is the website we played on in elementary school.
It was called Andkon.com. Oh it's still there. No way!
Wow. This hasn't changed a bit.
Have they even added games? Dude.
This game. This is what we played, Quicksand Hell
Oh my God. Oh man. It's really slow.
Why is this computer so (beep)? Ah, wow.
All right. Shout out, Andkon Arcade.
This was a lot of my childhood.
A lot of these things are pretty similar
to how they are nowadays.
Honestly, it might look different,
but I don't think it's really come that far
in terms of, "Wow, I have to click 17 different times
to change my refresh rate."
It's still kind of the case in Windows 11.
- I like this. We should all run Windows 98,
instead of 10.
- If you liked this fun archeological dig
into an old operating system,
you might like the time we took a look
at its even older predecessor.
Windows 95 on a laptop was pretty special
and a lot of fun. So go check that out.

I don't think so. System requirements
vista
xp 2000 me 98 se
pentium 3 700 megahertz or faster
64 megs of ram 10 megabytes
minimum free hard disk space 8 gigabytes
for full
install that means if there was actually
this number of games on the disc
they would each need to be around 50
kilobytes
or smaller in size and another
reason why I don't think this is true is
that
according to Mobygames in the entire
40-year history of the pc there has been
only about 65 000 games ever made
and that's including everything from the
original 1981
ibm pc dos games to the latest
Windows and linux games of today
so yeah there's definitely not 155,000
games
on this disc but nonetheless if we open
it up
we see it claims to have 10,000 casino
games
and 20,000 slot games also including
a six-pack of marvelous mystery
with their own I guess that's supposed
to be carmen san diego
kind of character and this is from 2009
and I like this do not make illegal
copies of this game
as if anybody would want to copy this
and here's the system I'm going to try
out on it's an hp pavilion dv 5000
running Windows xp media center edition
here's what's on the disk we have a
readme file so let's see what's in that
then the readme file it claims to have
333,000 games so they made it and they don't
even know how many games are on it
see the autorun launcher said 155,000
on that
and there's the menu we have a thousand
and one crystal caverns of aaron raw a
thousand one jewels of denial ten
thousand kakuro mania twenty five
thousand taipei majong fifteen thousand
games which doesn't even say what they
are
best games hits volumes one two three
forty five hundred slot games a thousand
one king solomon's lost mines a thousand
one dynasty of egypt ten thousand
hexagons
majong so even majong ten thousand
super weird games thirty thousand chess
brain teasers fifty thousand sudoku
mania three thousand puzzle games and a
thousand one mini golf challenge
so I'm gonna go of this unlabeled
as to what it is 15,000 games
it has its own menu here I'm going to go
with the 2002 games which doesn't even
say what it is
and here's what we have 2002 games
championship arcade in action carton
casino puzzle and board sudoku games
sports and more
word and brain and we have
200 space out games and they're cheating
by listing different maps of the same
game
separately so like each level of the
game is listed separately
I'll go over this first one here alien
ship shoot
what component Flash
ocx dependency not correctly
registered
so are these all Flash games
can I run any of these now these these
are all Flash games
I don't even know if I still have an old
copy of Flash I could install on this
and you would think it would include it
on the disc oh here's something I can
run
it's a pinball game but it ran a command
line for some reason
maximizing it didn't really help not
hearing any sound
how do I do the flippers so that's a
really boring pinball game that I don't
seem to have any control over
what else tomato bounce
that's another Flash game why did the
chicken cross the road
yeah these I gotta try to find a copy of
Flash
here's something tanks
are there no sound on any of these this
computer player keeps shooting me the
instant I appear on the screen
so that's no fun what about helicopter
OK we have helicopter here start in
Comic Sans
MS well at least it has sound
try again start
what am I supposed to do it just sinks
to the ground and
the instant I start now you have a
chance to show the world your skills as
a helicopter pilot simply avoid the
obstacles
be careful if you forget to ascend
you'll plummet
controls mouse button to ascend space
so that's like a flappy bird kind of
game
yeah exactly that it's like a flappy
... it's like a
helicopter version of flappy bird which
is going to wear out my mouse button
and just going by the screenshots it
reminds me of those Brazilian
games for the Sega Master System that
LGR reviewed
the same kind of throwing things around
in the kitchen kind of theme here
and here's some version of solitaire or
something I was able to run
and they all open a command prompt
window to run the game
all the ones that are not Flash games
I don't I don't even know what this is
what am I doing here
sorry but you lose I tried another game
and it went full screen on me but it was
just a blank screen and it wasn't
responding so looking at the task manager
here look at all these things running
even though
it's doing nothing here
I saw on Amazon somebody accused this
CD of having a trojan on it so needless
to say this computer is not connected
to my network right now and I'm going to
run a virus scan on it as soon as I'm
done there's another full screen game
but this one looks like it's actually
working
although I have again no clue what I'm
supposed to do here
just slowly walking along
and now what, is it kneeling down?
you lose what did they pay a 10 year old
to write this game
and honestly I think a lot of 10 year
olds would be able to write a better
game than this
and here's darts I don't understand how
could this
be any fun on a computer
when you can just aim it in the middle
and how come darts is making my computer
CPU fan
race like crazy this should not be that
processor intensive
what am I not allowed to go into the
side of the road
but I made that turn
here's kids sudoku I don't even know how
to play regular sudoku
sorry error is found
see it has Flash player so why is it
complaining that
you can't run the Flash games and this
is reminding me of that Linux video I
made because it can open multiple copies
of the same error message if I just keep
them open
you need to divine number thinked by CPU
well I'm not running this on a ThinkPad
so I don't think it's going to work
what is it doing
moving letters make right word for
shecking press button what is this
it's in Russian whatever it is probably
makes more sense in that language
yes this game is crazy
is it gonna sheck this word
OK... that's all it says here's the
program folder for those 2002
crappy mostly Flash games installed
2.3 gigabytes that's a lot more than I
expected
for the kind of quality of those games
over 10,000 files in 2600 folders
so what does every game have its own
subfolder in this thing
oh it's all these sudoku puzzles they
each have their own folder
that's why it's so much so I think this
gives you a pretty good
idea of what you can expect from this
155,000 game collection so that's
155,000 games on one disc I wouldn't even
call that
shovelware I'd call that dump truckware
"the internet is not something that you
just dump something on -- it's not a big
truck
it's a series of tubes!"

cursed and unholy PC CD-ROM software
hi
​​​ ​I love retro computers,​ ​​ ​​​ ​ so I end up collecting a lot of weird old PC junk​ ​​ ​​​ ​but one of my biggest weaknesses are PC CD-ROMs.​ ​​
​​​ ​From the occasional eBay haul and thrift store visit,​ ​​ ​​​ ​my CD-ROM collection has become densely packed​ ​​ ​​​ ​with all sorts of video games, programs,​ ​​
​​​ ​and other oddities from the late 90s and early 2000s.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I miss the days when a big software purchase​ ​​ ​​​ ​was physically represented​ ​​
​​​ ​by a gigantic box with some disks inside of it​ ​​ ​​​ ​ instead of an ephemeral five gigabyte installer file​ ​​
​​​ ​ transferred over the internet.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So, let's go back a few decades, when optical media was king​ ​​ ​​​ ​and take a look at some cursed and unholy CD-ROM software.​ ​​
​​​ ​So, for compatibility's sake,​ ​​ ​​​ ​I'll be using my period-accurate​ ​​ ​​​ ​2005 Windows XP rig for this video.​ ​​
​​​ ​No emulation, no virtual machines, this is the real deal.​ ​​ ​​​ ​As for the CD-ROMs,​ ​​ ​​​ ​we're starting off with the least cursed ​ ​​
​​​ ​and getting more ridiculous as we go.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So let's take a look at Nickelodeon Toon Twister 3-D, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​released by Scholastic in 2003.​ ​​
nickelodeon toon twister 3D
​​​ ​If seeing physical media being used ​ ​​ ​​​ ​on period-accurate hardware ​ ​​ ​​​ ​doesn't bring you immense satisfaction,​ ​​
​​​ ​you and I are not friends, I don't even know you.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The AutoRun runs the installer,​ ​​ ​​​ ​(delightful music)​ ​​​​ ​The AutoRun runs the installer,​ ​​ ​​​ ​(delightful music)​ ​​​​ ​which has a delightful bit of music.​ ​​ ​​​ ​(delightful music)​ ​​
​​​ ​Watching an InstallShield Wizard crawl​ ​​ ​​​ ​is peak nostalgia for me.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The InstallShield Wizard is complete,​ ​​
​​​ ​the game is installed, and apparently so is QuickTime.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So let's boot it up and see what happens!​ ​​
​​​ ​I had no idea this was made by WayForward,​ ​​ ​​​ ​we are in for a good time.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, it's like a little 3D movie maker type deal.​ ​​
​​​ ​And I decided to make a movie called "spongebob dies".​ ​​ ​​​ ​I think it would be really ambitious to have Spongebob die;​ ​​
​​​ ​I think that really enrich his character,​ ​​ ​​​ ​I think it would really bring depth to that world,​ ​​ ​​​ ​I'm an artist and this is my vision, what else can I say.​ ​​
​​​ ​So I plugged in my microphone,​ ​​ ​​​ ​AUUUUGH!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​It works!​ ​​ ​​​ ​and I got down to business.​ ​​
​​​ ​(sponge-y laugh)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Here I am! My friend Patrick!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Huh-huh!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Hey Spongebob, thanks for inviting me over to your house.​ ​​
​​​ ​I hope you don't die!​ ​​ ​​​ ​I hope I don't die either! That would be very unfortunate​ ​​
​​​ ​for my character development.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And then as soon as I clicked the "Edit" button,​ ​​ ​​​ ​the computer instantly bluescreened.​ ​​
​​​ ​I mean, that feels like kind of an overreaction, but sure.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Generally a blue screen's not really a big deal,​ ​​ ​​​ ​you can just reboot and then you're fine,​ ​​
​​​ ​but in this instance,​ ​​ ​​​ ​I couldn't.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It just refused to boot back up,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it was stuck on the BIOS screen.​ ​​
​​​ ​So I put in an hour of troubleshooting,​ ​​ ​​​ ​ and you're not gonna believe what happened.​ ​​ ​​​ ​That spectacular Toon Twister 3-D crash​ ​​
​​​ ​killed one of my sticks of RAM, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and that's why the PC wouldn't boot up anymore.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The universe gifted me the most poetic ending​ ​​
​​​ ​to "spongebob dies"​ ​​ ​​​ ​that could have ever possibly existed.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Ok, moving on, next up we have Tamagotchi CD-ROM,​ ​​
tamagotchi CD-ROM
​​​ ​released in 1997;​ ​​ ​​​ ​I wanted to talk about this in my original Tamagotchi video​ ​​ ​​​ ​but I didn't really get the chance.​ ​​
​​​ ​So, let's open the good 'ol SETUP.EXE...​ ​​ ​​​ ​"Now all the fun of Tamagotchi, the virtual reality PET,​ ​​
​​​ ​comes to your computer!"​ ​​ ​​​ ​Yes, amazing!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(whimsical sound effect)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Once it finishes installing,​ ​​​​ ​(whimsical sound effect)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Once it finishes installing,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it asks if you wanna make your default Screen Saver.​ ​​
​​​ ​Actually great idea!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Tamagotchi CD-ROM opens with a lengthy cutscene.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I love the style at play here,​ ​​
​​​ ​how everything looks like it's drawn with crayons​ ​​ ​​​ ​ and this very overly cartoony look.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I think it's great.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's very reminiscent of ToeJam & Earl, ​ ​​
​​​ ​which this almost certainly was inspired by.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's so similar.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Tamagotchi have always been weird, cartoony aliens​ ​​
​​​ ​but, like, seeing it this distinctly American tone ​ ​​ ​​​ ​is really interesting.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The aliens narrowly avoid crashing into the Earth.​ ​​
​​​ ​And then they leave an egg to explore the planet​ ​​ ​​​ ​on their behalf.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And the baby creature that hatches from that egg ​ ​​
​​​ ​is the Tamagotchi that you take care of in the game.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The entire game takes place in this little window​ ​​ ​​​ ​and window can actually flash on and off​ ​​
​​​ ​ to get your attention.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The art, and the animations, and the sound design are top tier;​ ​​ ​​​ ​this is like, such an immaculately quality thing.​ ​​
​​​ ​It's so fully realized and it feels so polished that, like,​ ​​ ​​​ ​if classic Tamagotchi hadn't been limited ​ ​​
​​​ ​to the low resolution LCD screens in the mid to late 90's,​ ​​ ​​​ ​this is what I imagine Tamagotchi would've looked like.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The first two games are the same as the Gen 1 handheld,​ ​​
​​​ ​but the third game...​ ​​ ​​​ ​is completely original and it's a Breakout clone, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and a really good one!​ ​​
​​​ ​A really high resolution, really fun one!​ ​​ ​​​ ​And the physics are great!​ ​​ ​​​ ​It feels so good!​ ​​ ​​​ ​I'm a simple man: if I see a Breakout clone, I just eat it up, OK?​ ​​
​​​ ​But yeah, the reason the Tamagotchi window is so small​ ​​ ​​​ ​is because they want this to be an accessory to your life​ ​​
​​​ ​in the same way that the handhelds were!​ ​​ ​​​ ​You can just leave it open in the corner of your screen​ ​​ ​​​ ​while you're doing whatever else!​ ​​
​​​ ​In this instance, watching Homestar Runner.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, Tamagotchi CD-ROM is really good!​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's aged great, I think it's a masterpiece.​ ​​
​​​ ​And by the way, just so you know,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it works perfectly in Windows 11.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Ok, before we get to the next CD-ROM, it's time for the ad.​ ​​
sponsor

​​​ ​and having zip pockets on the pants is always a plus for me.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's been pretty hot, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​so the breathable and sweat wicking material​ ​​
​​​ ​has been a lifesaver for when I hit the gym.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But Fabletics are for more than just the treadmill,​ ​​ ​​​ ​they're just as applicable for running errands,​ ​​

​​​ ​I'm sure you won't regret it!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Alrighty, movin' on!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Next up we got Expert's 250 Best Arcade Games from 1998.​ ​​
expert 250 best arcade games
​​​ ​Unfortunately, "250 Best Arcade Games" is​ ​​ ​​​ ​ a bit of deceptive marketing,​ ​​ ​​​ ​but we will get there.​ ​​
​​​ ​But yeah, the install completed​ ​​ ​​​ ​ and it asks me to reboot my computer.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And if you hit no, it's like​ ​​ ​​​ ​"Don't forget to reboot before the running the program! 3:<"​ ​​
​​​ ​and so I'm like, OK FINE! I'll reboot then!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(Windows XP Shutdown Sound)​ ​​
​​​ ​(Windows XP Startup Sound)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Look, it's Windows XP,​ ​​​​ ​(Windows XP Startup Sound)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Look, it's Windows XP,​ ​​ ​​​ ​ I can't just not engage with the nostalgia.​ ​​
​​​ ​So, 250 Best Arcade Games, you have this little browser.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Inexplicably, like, 80% of the games don't have images.​ ​​
​​​ ​Like, right away, you can just look at this and be like,​ ​​ ​​​ ​"Ok, they put an unfinished product​ ​​
​​​ ​to retail."​ ​​ ​​​ ​As far as I can tell, all of the games function​ ​​ ​​​ ​but like, more than half of them are for DOS?​ ​​
​​​ ​I'm running Windows XP which can do DOS mode games;​ ​​ ​​​ ​however, DOS games don't show up ​ ​​ ​​​ ​on my capture for some reason?​ ​​
​​​ ​I assume it's really low resolution​ ​​ ​​​ ​ and it doesn't know how to parse it?​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, anyway,​ ​​ ​​​ ​for an arcade collection, it hits all the notes you'd expect:​ ​​
​​​ ​it's got a Pac-Man clone, it's got a clone of Dr. Mario,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's got a clone of Tempest, it's got a Lunar Lander type game...​ ​​
​​​ ​Good stuff, right?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Well, I started to notice a little bit of a pattern.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I've been getting a suspiciously high amount of ​ ​​
​​​ ​shareware pop-ups from these games.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Now, if you're not as old as I am-​ ​​ ​​​ ​(ironic chuckle)​ ​​
​​​ ​Then you might not know what shareware is.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It basically means that the software ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that you're using is a free demo​ ​​ ​​​ ​and if you like it,​ ​​
​​​ ​you're encouraged to pay for it to unlock the full version.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So-​ ​​ ​​​ ​W-Wait... No...​ ​​ ​​​ ​Are you, like, allowed to put a bunch of free demos on a disk​ ​​
​​​ ​and then sell it to people??​ ​​ ​​​ ​Well, they sure seem to be,​ ​​ ​​​ ​because they're phrasing the shareware angle as a feature!​ ​​
​​​ ​It's to save you money,​ ​​ ​​​ ​because you get to evaluate all the games ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and only buy the ones you really enjoy!​ ​​
​​​ ​How generous of them.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Don't get me wrong, shareware disks are great ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and they made sense at the time​ ​​ ​​​ ​because internet speeds were slow;​ ​​
​​​ ​but I feel like the marketing's​ ​​ ​​​ ​a little bit deceptive on this one.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Regardless, there were three games ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that this disk introduced me to ​ ​​
​​​ ​that I ended up really liking:​ ​​ ​​​ ​the first one was DX-Ball ​ ​​ ​​​ ​which is a breakout clone that I thought was really fun.​ ​​
​​​ ​There was Exile III, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​which is a really crunchy and detailed tile-based RPG.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I sank a few hours into this game,​ ​​
​​​ ​I'm definitely gonna get the full version cuz it was so fun.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And finally, Jiji and the Mysterious Forest,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's a tiny little indie RPG made in 1994.​ ​​
​​​ ​It's super cute and charming, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and I played through the game in its entirety.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Ok, moving on!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Next up we've got​ ​​ ​​​ ​Ultimate Solitare-​ ​​
ultimate solitaire 1000
​​​ ​1000 Unique Games??​ ​​ ​​​ ​(stutters) For solitare? How??​ ​​
​​​ ​I don't believe you.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The first thing the game has you do, when you start it up,​ ​​ ​​​ ​is pick your table image.​ ​​
​​​ ​And they have a lot of good options here, like a smiley face,​ ​​ ​​​ ​and just somebodies house?​ ​​ ​​​ ​But naturally, I had to go with the pineapples.​ ​​
​​​ ​Because...​ ​​ ​​​ ​(chuckle)​ ​​ ​​​ ​And for the card backs, I had to go with pizza!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(wheeze)​ ​​
​​​ ​There's a little Italian man on my cards!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Now this is the part where I get kind of humbled because​ ​​
​​​ ​yeah, there uhh, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​there do seem to be a thousand unique games in here...​ ​​ ​​​ ​I don't know how creative or original they may be, but​ ​​
​​​ ​there are that many.​ ​​ ​​​ ​For instance, "Why Not?"!​ ​​ ​​​ ​So I loaded up a game of good 'ol Klondike ​ ​​ ​​​ ​with my stupid cards and my stupid background,​ ​​
​​​ ​and yeah, it's perfectly fine.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's a plenty competent solitaire game.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Let's see if we can learn a little more​ ​​
​​​ ​about the alternative game modes, though.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Okay, here's the instructions​ ​​ ​​​ ​for all the different solitaire games,​ ​​ ​​​ ​uh, first off there's​ ​​
​​​ ​"Aaaaa."​ ​​ ​​​ ​Anybody got a pack of cards? I would love to play some​ ​​ ​​​ ​"Aaaaa"~!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​We've also got the old classic, "Angry german."​ ​​
​​​ ​Would you like a "Christmas beetle" with your "Club sandwich"?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Why yes, this is the part of the video​ ​​ ​​​ ​where we're just gonna laugh at funny names for a minute.​ ​​
​​​ ​We've got options.​ ​​ ​​​ ​We've got "Daddy long legs,"​ ​​ ​​​ ​we've got "Daddy long legs 2,"​ ​​ ​​​ ​we've got "Daddy long legs 3,"​ ​​ ​​​ ​and we've got "Daddy long legs dad."​ ​​
​​​ ​Answer me this,​ ​​ ​​​ ​what separates the "Double Downward Men" ​ ​​ ​​​ ​from the "Double Downward Boys"?​ ​​ ​​​ ​And don't even get me started​ ​​ ​​​ ​on the "Double Downward Super Men."​ ​​
​​​ ​Did you see those "Turtle graphics", ​ ​​ ​​​ ​or were you distracted by the "Unseen Mamma Mia"?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Okay, sorry, I'm done.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Don't mark that as filler on SponsorBlock.​ ​​
galaxy of games
​​​ ​Next up, we have Galaxy of Games from 1998​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it claims to have 50 full-featured original games!​ ​​
​​​ ​So no shareware nonsense like last time.​ ​​ ​​​ ​As soon as you pop the disk in, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​it autoplays this cool intro for Galaxy Software! B)​ ​​
​​​ ​So, right away,​ ​​ ​​​ ​I noticed that the 50 games claim was already inaccurate.​ ​​ ​​​ ​There are 23,​ ​​
​​​ ​and they're claiming that the solitaire game is 25 games.​ ​​ ​​​ ​They're still short by two, but I guess that's close enough.​ ​​
​​​ ​I mean, this is modest compared to the other solitaire game​ ​​ ​​​ ​claiming that it's 1000 games in one​ ​​ ​​​ ​so I guess fair enough.​ ​​ ​​​ ​First off is Tunnel Blaster*.​ ​​
​​​ ​It's a Dig Dug clone, a very mediocre one.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Intergalactic Exterminator is a clone of Centipede.​ ​​
​​​ ​Blast* Thru, you'll never guess what this game is a clone of.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Galactic Patrol is actually the most original game so far,​ ​​
​​​ ​which is a shame because it's not very good.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's a 3D shmup but, like,​ ​​ ​​​ ​there's no crosshair, so you have no point of reference​ ​​
​​​ ​for like, where your bullets are gonna go?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Because your enemies also can move on the Z axis,​ ​​
​​​ ​it's very hard to read and very confusing.​ ​​ ​​​ ​A couple of the games in this collection​ ​​ ​​​ ​just don't seem to work,​ ​​ ​​​ ​like, you'll open them and they give a script error​ ​​
​​​ ​and then just close.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The absolute strangest game in this collection​ ​​ ​​​ ​is Adventures with Chickens.​ ​​
​​​ ​This game is the very last on the list, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I guess they were saving the best for last?​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's a puzzle game kinda like Chip's Challenge ​ ​​
​​​ ​for lack of better comparison?​ ​​ ​​​ ​And you collect Roman crosses and chickens​ ​​
​​​ ​and you kill aliens.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And at the start of every level,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it shows you a bible verse.​ ​​
​​​ ​(chuckle)​ ​​ ​​​ ​This game is truly unhinged and I had so much fun with it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​All I want from my video games ​ ​​
​​​ ​are for them to be aggressively weird like this.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Just give me all of this.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Next up, we have a Konami Dance Masters demo disc​ ​​
dance masters taco bell promo disc
​​​ ​from Taco Bell.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It is so weird to say Konami and Taco Bell​ ​​ ​​​ ​in the same sentence(!)​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, this thing released in 2010 and it supports,​ ​​
​​​ ​at minimum, Windows XP Service Pack 3​ ​​ ​​​ ​so we're chillin'.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Also, forgive me, this sleeve is very weird to open.​ ​​
​​​ ​(chuckle)​ ​​ ​​​ ​So, I tried to install the DanceMasters thing ​ ​​ ​​​ ​straight off the disk,​ ​​ ​​​ ​um, and it just wasn't working,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it kept saying it was corrupted?​ ​​
​​​ ​I think this disk might be dead.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Now that would be an issue​ ​​ ​​​ ​if I hadn't had the intuition four years ago​ ​​
​​​ ​to dump the disk when I got it!​ ​​ ​​​ ​So I downloaded my own rip of the disk off of archive.org,​ ​​
​​​ ​and it installed no problem!​ ​​ ​​​ ​I couldn't've known my disk was going to​ ​​ ​​​ ​stop working four years after I dumped it.​ ​​
​​​ ​This exact scenario is why you, personally,​ ​​ ​​​ ​should dump the media you value and archive it​ ​​
​​​ ​so future generations can appreciate the...​ ​​ ​​​ ​Taco Bell...​ ​​ ​​​ ​Dance Masters disk.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So once you get the game started up,​ ​​
​​​ ​uh, there's a user agreement,​ ​​ ​​​ ​and there's a line in here that says,​ ​​ ​​​ ​"Prohibition of Cheating and Impropriety",​ ​​
​​​ ​it's basically saying, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​"hey, if you modify the game to cheat, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​then you're violating the terms of service," right?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Just keep that in mind for later.​ ​​
​​​ ​I'm sorry, I have to mute the music ​ ​​ ​​​ ​because I guarantee all of it's in Content ID.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But, yeah, this is the UI.​ ​​
​​​ ​Looks great, doesn't it?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Here's the "Help" menu.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's just 3 sentences!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(laughs)​ ​​
​​​ ​Here's the game!​ ​​ ​​​ ​You have four songs to choose from,​ ​​ ​​​ ​and when you pick one it just...​ ​​ ​​​ ​(laughing hard)​ ​​​​ ​and when you pick one it just...​ ​​
​​​ ​(laughing hard)​ ​​ ​​​ ​It just puts a full screen video, in Windows Media Player,​ ​​
​​​ ​of footage of the XBOX 360 game!​ ​​ ​​​ ​This is just the DDR DVD game again!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Where you just pretend that you're playing a dance game!​ ​​
​​​ ​And the user agreement is like,​ ​​ ​​​ ​"No cheating! 🤓☝"​ ​​ ​​​ ​"No cheating at this WMV video file!"​ ​​
​​​ ​"If I see any impropriety with these video files..."​ ​​ ​​​ ​"You can't come to my birthday party, you understand? >:("​ ​​
​​​ ​Aren't you guys glad I had a backup of this disk?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Otherwise, you would've never gotten to experience this.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Next up, we've got Hanes T-ShirtMaker Version 2, ​ ​​
hanes t-shirt maker
​​​ ​released in 1998.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This software is so much fun!​ ​​ ​​​ ​I had such a great time with it!​ ​​ ​​​ ​So when you start a new project,​ ​​
​​​ ​it gives you a ton of templates to choose from ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that you can customize to your liking.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And, there's so much comedy potential here.​ ​​
​​​ ​This template was just "We are not alone" ​ ​​ ​​​ ​with a picture of an alien​ ​​ ​​​ ​but I like my version a lot better.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This template says​ ​​
​​​ ​"God couldn't be everywhere, so he created artists."​ ​​ ​​​ ​So let's just update this piece for the modern age.​ ​​
​​​ ​This dude's working from home making six figures.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Priorities:​ ​​ ​​​ ​Number one is golf,​ ​​ ​​​ ​number two is golf,​ ​​
​​​ ​number three is golf,​ ​​ ​​​ ​number four is​ ​​ ​​​ ​number four is contacting a divorce attorney.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This template you're supposed to, like, fill in the blank.​ ​​
​​​ ​But it is so much funnier​ ​​ ​​​ ​if you just delete the bottom text​ ​​ ​​​ ​so it just says "I'm a prisoner."​ ​​ ​​​ ​Some of these templates are completely unapplicable,​ ​​
​​​ ​like what am I supposed to do with this?​ ​​ ​​​ ​(in a cool manner) "Addicted to the Net."​ ​​ ​​​ ​Y'know what I'm addicted to?​ ​​ ​​​ ​family guy funny moments​ ​​
​​​ ​This shirt is more personalized now!​ ​​ ​​​ ​"I work in computers!"​ ​​ ​​​ ​Yeah, no.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Unemployed and proud!​ ​​
​​​ ​And then they're playing Overwatch 2.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Although, you could really just put ​ ​​ ​​​ ​whatever game you think is lame into the monitor.​ ​​
​​​ ​I bet there's gonna be like 3000 commenters ​ ​​ ​​​ ​on this video like,​ ​​ ​​​ ​"I would genuinely buy the 'I'm a Prisoner' t-shirt-"​ ​​
​​​ ​Look, youtuber merch is bad enough as-is.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Don't tempt me to make it worse. 3:<​ ​​ ​​​ ​Next up, we've got Paper Airplane Print Activities​ ​​
paper airplane print activities
​​​ ​from 1998.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Notice how it says​ ​​ ​​​ ​"Easy-to-follow instructions" on the front,​ ​​ ​​​ ​keep that in mind for later.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So, the software has ten different ​ ​​
​​​ ​types of planes you can make,​ ​​ ​​​ ​and then you get to choose ​ ​​ ​​​ ​what kind of graphics you want before you print it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And of course, it gives it also gives you​ ​​
​​​ ​an instruction sheet that you print out as well​ ​​ ​​​ ​so that you know how to fold it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​As cute as this software is, we've got some planes to make.​ ​​
​​​ ​I have decided to make the B-45 Bomber, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​as well as the F-160 Snub Nose.​ ​​
​​​ ​I'm going to be making the Super Sonic Bomber​ ​​ ​​​ ​and the F-110 Glider.​ ​​
​​​ ​So, you're about to,​ ​​ ​​​ ​uh, realize the same thing that I did,​ ​​ ​​​ ​which is that you have to know ​ ​​
​​​ ​which way you have to orient the paper before you start.​ ​​ ​​​ ​That's kind of confusing, cuz they don't tell you.​ ​​ ​​​ ​What do you mean to "refold to make a triangle like this"?​ ​​
​​​ ​I don't know what that means.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I have this currently,​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it doesn't look like that.​ ​​
​​​ ​"Then fold up the corners"?​ ​​ ​​​ ​What corners!?​ ​​ ​​​ ​These instructions are a little bit shoddy.​ ​​
​​​ ​I'm- I'm stuck on step three!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Fold flap here.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Uh-huh.​ ​​​​ ​Fold flap here.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This part will go under.​ ​​
​​​ ​So it forms-​ ​​ ​​​ ​Under what??​ ​​​​ ​So it forms-​ ​​ ​​​ ​Under what??​ ​​ ​​​ ​Under- under this!​ ​​​​ ​Under what??​ ​​ ​​​ ​Under- under this!​ ​​​​ ​Under this one??​ ​​ ​​​ ​Under- under this!​ ​​ ​​​ ​It goes (?)-​ ​​ ​​​ ​Oh, the whole thing!​ ​​​​ ​It goes (?)-​ ​​ ​​​ ​Oh, the whole thing!​ ​​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Yes.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Under here like this?​ ​​
​​​ ​Mm-hmm.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Oh! Okay.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Look, I finished my plane! It is the jellyfish.​ ​​
​​​ ​Uhh, F-160 Snub Nose.​ ​​ ​​​ ​(light applause)​ ​​​​ ​Uhh, F-160 Snub Nose.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Uhh, F-160 Snub Nose.​ ​​ ​​​ ​What do you mean "behind the body"?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Like fold it up?​ ​​
​​​ ​They don't do that in airplane... level.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's just like, crease it a hundred times right here​ ​​ ​​​ ​and then just kinda make it into like a fortune cookie​ ​​
​​​ ​ and then it becomes this little diamond shape.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Cool.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Just draw the rest of the owl.​ ​​ ​​​ ​They really expected you​ ​​
​​​ ​to already be a paper airplane person.​ ​​ ​​​ ​That's what I was saying,​ ​​ ​​​ ​ like this made for experts and not for four year olds.​ ​​
​​​ ​If they want YouTubers to understand it easily,​ ​​ ​​​ ​(chuckle)​ ​​​​ ​If they want YouTubers to understand it easily,​ ​​ ​​​ ​you have to make it for four year olds.​ ​​ ​​​ ​You have to make it for four year olds!​ ​​​​ ​you have to make it for four year olds.​ ​​
​​​ ​You have to make it for four year olds!​ ​​ ​​​ ​They have to do journalist difficulty paper airplanes.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Now...​ ​​​​ ​They have to do journalist difficulty paper airplanes.​ ​​ ​​​ ​They have to do journalist difficulty paper airplanes.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Yeah, well, I'm a YouTuber ​ ​​​​ ​They have to do journalist difficulty paper airplanes.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Yeah, well, I'm a YouTuber ​ ​​ ​​​ ​(Anime "Wow!" SFX)​ ​​​​ ​Yeah, well, I'm a YouTuber ​ ​​ ​​​ ​(Anime "Wow!" SFX)​ ​​​​ ​and I'm making paper airplanes right now​ ​​
​​​ ​(Anime "Wow!" SFX)​ ​​​​ ​and I'm doing a good job.​ ​​ ​​​ ​and I'm doing a good job.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This is my jellyfish plane, it is the F-160 Snub Nose,​ ​​ ​​​ ​and this is my, uh, smiley face plane​ ​​
​​​ ​which is the, uh, B-45 Bomber.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And it has a little tail on the end!​ ​​
​​​ ​There's my two paper airplanes.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Hey, I'm gonna throw this at you​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it's really gonna hurt cuz of how pointy it is.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Alright?​ ​​
​​​ ​Okay. :3​ ​​ ​​​ ​AAUGGH!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​The instructions could be a little better, but this was fun.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This is a nice, like, thing to do.​ ​​
​​​ ​I will upload this to archive.org, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​as far as I know this is undumped.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Um, but yeah.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This is uh, Print Activies Paper (Air)plane,​ ​​
​​​ ​from uh, what was it,​ ​​ ​​​ ​1998? Yeah. 1998.​ ​​ ​​​ ​That was pretty cool!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Next up we have Sierra Home Architect from the year 2000.​ ​​
sierra home architect
​​​ ​Hopefully this software will let me build a 3D house​ ​​ ​​​ ​like in The Sims, that would be so good.​ ​​ ​​​ ​"Welcome to Sierra Home Architect."​ ​​
​​​ ​"Where you can create the home of your dreams."​ ​​ ​​​ ​Oh, it's so good!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Oh, I already love this!​ ​​
​​​ ​Oh good, it found my graphics card.​ ​​ ​​​ ​That's nice.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Ohh, d- okay...​ ​​ ​​​ ​Well, it's def-​ ​​
​​​ ​(chuckle-wheeze)​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's definitely not supposed to be doing that!​ ​​
​​​ ​"3D graphics may put your computer to the test."​ ​​ ​​​ ​Sierra Home Architect may destroy your graphics card​ ​​
​​​ ​from the inside out, actually!​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, basically I turned off the ​ ​​ ​​​ ​3D hardware acceleration and then everything was fine.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, there's a whole bunch of sample homes​ ​​
​​​ ​in this software that you can walk around in​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it's really, really cool.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It feels very PS1.​ ​​
​​​ ​There is a ton of detail involved in this software!​ ​​ ​​​ ​You can do like multiple floors,​ ​​ ​​​ ​you can do the interior, the exterior,​ ​​
​​​ ​you can change room layouts,​ ​​ ​​​ ​you can add in all your own decorations and furniture...​ ​​
​​​ ​This is seriously impressive for the year 2000.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Like, genuinely.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So I designed my dream home using Sierra Home Architect,​ ​​
​​​ ​there's one bedroom and 23 bathrooms.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So, when you first enter the home,​ ​​ ​​​ ​we really wanted to make a good first impression ​ ​​
​​​ ​by starting off in the bathroom,​ ​​ ​​​ ​there's a sink right there.​ ​​ ​​​ ​You also have four doors right away, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that will lead to the other rooms.​ ​​
​​​ ​If you head into room to the right, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​you are greeted with the bathroom.​ ​​ ​​​ ​There's a toilet here, as well as a sink and a towel rack.​ ​​
​​​ ​Um, and then if you head into this room here,​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​This is a, uh, sink with a toilet.​ ​​
​​​ ​Uh, that one's blocking that door, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​but you can still go through if you squeeze through.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​We actually had a wizard cast a spell on that cup ​ ​​
​​​ ​to make it float ominously.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Uh, if you head into this room, welcome to the bathroom.​ ​​ ​​​ ​There's a toilet and nothing else.​ ​​
​​​ ​If you head into this room, there's a towel in this room!​ ​​ ​​​ ​That's another bonus feature there.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​So, in this bathroom, ​ ​​
​​​ ​we've replaced the toilet with a pool table​ ​​ ​​​ ​but you can still pee on it ​ ​​ ​​​ ​just like you would if it were a toilet.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​
​​​ ​This room has two toilets in it, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that's for competitive pooping.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's to see who can fire a log out faster.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcom-​ ​​ ​​​ ​(chuckle)​ ​​
​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom.​ ​​ ​​​ ​There's a pinball machine in here, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​we had the toilet removed to make space for it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And if you take a look in here,​ ​​
​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Welcome to the bathroom!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Uh, there's some towels blocking the door over there,​ ​​ ​​​ ​but hey, you have a sink and a scale as well in this room.​ ​​
​​​ ​Now this next room has a very special addition,​ ​​ ​​​ ​we have a countertop with some flowers, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and a mirror, and some tissues.​ ​​
​​​ ​In this bathroom.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So this bathroom has a shower tub combo in it,​ ​​ ​​​ ​that's going to cost you approximately​ ​​
​​​ ​30​ ​​ ​​​ ​3,000​ ​​ ​​​ ​3,000,000-​ ​​ ​​​ ​(wheeze)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Y'know, getting lost in your own home,​ ​​ ​​​ ​uh, trying to find your bedroom ​ ​​
​​​ ​is part of the experience-​ ​​ ​​​ ​Oh, there we-!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(laughs)​ ​​ ​​​ ​We found the bedroom!​ ​​
​​​ ​And we even put framed photos ​ ​​ ​​​ ​of people you've never met on your set of drawers ​ ​​ ​​​ ​so that you'll feel less lonely at night!​ ​​
​​​ ​That was a lot of fun! I enjoyed this a lot.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Next up, we have 6000 Sound effects by Cosmi.​ ​​
cosmi 6000 sound effects
​​​ ​Originally released in 1998, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​but this particular disk is a reprint from 2005.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Sound effect CDs are traditionally written ​ ​​
​​​ ​to the audio track so you can play it in like, a CD player.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But this one is only for CD-ROM.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The only way to access the sounds ​ ​​
​​​ ​is through its proprietary Windows software.​ ​​ ​​​ ​All the sounds are tagged, and you can't export them in bulk.​ ​​ ​​​ ​You can only export them individually.​ ​​
​​​ ​The sound quality was perfectly fine for 1998 standards,​ ​​ ​​​ ​but today these sounds are absolutely unusable.​ ​​
​​​ ​8000 hertz at 64 kbps is comically low quality.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I can imagine myself using these sounds ​ ​​
​​​ ​if I were trying to make a period piece,​ ​​ ​​​ ​like a game that pays homage to ​ ​​ ​​​ ​Flash or Shockwave games from the late 90s.​ ​​
​​​ ​It would fit for that use case, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​otherwise these sounds are completely useless.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I took a look at the manual to see what the license terms were, ​ ​​
​​​ ​and the sounds are indeed royalty free​ ​​ ​​​ ​but you have to email Cosmi for permission.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The problem is...​ ​​
​​​ ​Cosmi is gone?​ ​​ ​​​ ​They have long since dissolved, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and their site just leads to nothing.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But I did some tracing back, ​ ​​
​​​ ​and I found that they were acquired by Ziggurat Games​ ​​ ​​​ ​who are still active today.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So I emailed them for permission, ​ ​​
​​​ ​and I'm still waiting to hear back.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Hopefully they permit my use ​ ​​ ​​​ ​of the royalty free sound effects ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that are on this CD-ROM I purchased.​ ​​
​​​ ​Not that I would, but it's nice to have the option.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So, speaking of gigantic packs of assets,​ ​​ ​​​ ​this is ClickArt 300,000, released in 1997.​ ​​
clickart 300,000
​​​ ​It's a 20 CD-ROM set of royalty free graphics and clip art.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Look at all these disks, ​ ​​
​​​ ​it just keeps going and going and going!​ ​​ ​​​ ​And they even give you a copy ​ ​​ ​​​ ​of the PrintShop Premier Edition​ ​​
​​​ ​and the PrintShop Photo Organizer!​ ​​ ​​​ ​But how do you keep track of all those images?​ ​​ ​​​ ​300,000 assets is pretty ridiculous.​ ​​
​​​ ​Well, they thought of that. ​ ​​ ​​​ ​They made these enormous graphic reference books.​ ​​ ​​​ ​You flip through and find the image you want, ​ ​​
​​​ ​and then you can use its ID to find what disk to use,​ ​​ ​​​ ​and in what folder.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So let's see if we can find this image of sour cream.​ ​​
​​​ ​So you on the left, this would be disk 6​ ​​ ​​​ ​and in the folder "FOOD_BEV\DAIRY."​ ​​ ​​​ ​And then once we get there, it's ID BCD00001.​ ​​
​​​ ​So, once you pop in the disk in, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​you just headed to "FOOD_BEV" and then "DAIRY,"​ ​​ ​​​ ​and then we're looking for BCD00001, ​ ​​
​​​ ​which is near the bottom right here.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's in a WMF format, which is a vector format.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Which you just get way more bang for your buck ​ ​​
​​​ ​with vectors than rasters;​ ​​ ​​​ ​because with rasters, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​there's a limited number of pixels in an image,​ ​​ ​​​ ​but with vectors, ​ ​​
​​​ ​you can just zoom it in infinitely.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Anyway, we found our sour cream image from the book! ​ ​​ ​​​ ​Amazing!​ ​​ ​​​ ​It is a lot easier to find the image you're looking for ​ ​​
​​​ ​if you set Explorer to thumbnail mode.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Look at these tacos, they look delicious! ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I wanna eat 'em!​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, I didn't actually have a ton to say about ClickArt.​ ​​
​​​ ​I just think it's really interesting to have ​ ​​ ​​​ ​such a dense collection of graphical assets ​ ​​ ​​​ ​from 27 years ago.​ ​​
omg they still make these things
​​​ ​So, this segment I'm going to call​ ​​ ​​​ ​I'm going to show you some CD-ROMs ​ ​​
​​​ ​that aren't necessarily interesting enough ​ ​​ ​​​ ​to talk about on their own,​ ​​ ​​​ ​but it's fascinating the fact that ​ ​​ ​​​ ​they came out within the last decade.​ ​​
​​​ ​This is Maker Fun Factory, Clip Art & Resources.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's a CD-ROM full of clip art for some kind of church group​ ​​
​​​ ​or event, or something?​ ​​ ​​​ ​I think this requires too much context ​ ​​ ​​​ ​for it to like, have it own segment but​ ​​ ​​​ ​it came out in 2017,​ ​​
​​​ ​and it's crazy that there's still demand ​ ​​ ​​​ ​for clip art CD-ROMs in 2017!​ ​​
​​​ ​You could just download them!​ ​​ ​​​ ​This right here is Amazing Hidden Object Games, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​(evily) Terrifying Tales.​ ​​
​​​ ​Hidden object games are very conceptually uninteresting.​ ​​ ​​​ ​They're like, the podcast equivalent of video games.​ ​​
​​​ ​But yeah, this thing released in 2016.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This game came out after Undertale.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I have another one here called ​ ​​
​​​ ​Hidden Object Classic Treasures II,​ ​​ ​​​ ​that released in 2018!​ ​​
​​​ ​I have yet to see a CD-ROM that is newer than this.​ ​​ ​​​ ​If you have any idea ​ ​​ ​​​ ​where I can get CD-ROM games that are newer than this​ ​​
​​​ ​or any companies that are making CD-ROM games for PC now,​ ​​ ​​​ ​let me know, genuinely.​ ​​
​​​ ​I have saved the best for last,​ ​​ ​​​ ​this is Big World of Games released in 2015.​ ​​
big world of games
​​​ ​Weirdly, I found this at Micro Center​ ​​ ​​​ ​and as soon as I saw it, I knew I had to buy it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Because like,​ ​​
​​​ ​what?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Why is Micro Center selling computer games on CD-ROM?​ ​​ ​​​ ​What?!​ ​​ ​​​ ​There are two disks, ​ ​​
​​​ ​and they claim there are over 50 games.​ ​​ ​​​ ​No, there are 50. ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I don't know why they're saying "over" 50.​ ​​
​​​ ​There... There are 50.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, we got a big goofy AutoRun installer thing​ ​​ ​​​ ​and you just click a game, ​ ​​
​​​ ​and then you run the Setup Wizard.​ ​​ ​​​ ​American Lowrider is an absolutely beautiful racing game​ ​​ ​​​ ​where youuu drive around lowriding cars.​ ​​
​​​ ​And uh, yeah it's okay. ​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's pretty generic but not bad at all.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Looks amazing on this hardware.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Aqua Fish is an aquatic themed clone of Pac-Man.​ ​​
​​​ ​ATV GP is like Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing but for ATVs.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This game is so unbelievably busted,​ ​​
​​​ ​watch this guy disappear.​ ​​ ​​​ ​(evil laughter)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Goodbye, idiot!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Look at these cardboard cutouts of people, ​ ​​
​​​ ​they didn't even try!​ ​​ ​​​ ​The race doesn't end ​ ​​ ​​​ ​until all of the AI opponents cross the finish line,​ ​​
​​​ ​but they were all stuck on this hill, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and so the race couldn't end!​ ​​ ​​​ ​So I was just forced to watch ​ ​​ ​​​ ​these AI players fail to drive up a hill ​ ​​
​​​ ​for like, five minutes until I eventually got bored ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and force closed the game.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Hercules: Battle with* the Gods is like a...​ ​​
​​​ ​2.5D clone of Rainbow Island, I guess?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Bug Mania, it's the same thing as the lowrider game​ ​​
​​​ ​but instead of lowriders it's uh, Beetles.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Cocoto Fun Fair, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's a Rabbids-like shooting gallery minigame collection.​ ​​
​​​ ​It's pretty stylish and pretty good!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Cocoto Platform Jumper,​ ​​ ​​​ ​literally the exact same thing as the Hercules game, ​ ​​
​​​ ​just with a different character.​ ​​ ​​​ ​(chuckle)​ ​​ ​​​ ​You can't just swap the character and call it a different game!​ ​​
​​​ ​That doesn't count!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Cocoto Kart Racer, a very competent clone of Mario Kart.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I had a really fun time with this one, ​ ​​
​​​ ​they nailed the physics.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Crazy Cars is a very low budget clone of Burnout 3, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​but a really fun one.​ ​​
​​​ ​Like it hits all the notes that it wanted to hit, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I'm probably gonna play this on my own time.​ ​​ ​​​ ​EA, can you stop sniffing your own farts for one second​ ​​
​​​ ​and give us what we really want, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​which is a new Burnout game??​ ​​ ​​​ ​Crazy Planes!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(laughs)​ ​​
​​​ ​I feel like I'm going crazy looking at the-​ ​​ ​​​ ​Crazy Planes!!!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Woooo!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(small laugh)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Weeeeee!!!​ ​​ ​​​ ​(laughs)​ ​​
​​​ ​This game is completely unintelligible.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I could not tell you what was happening in it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Dino is a very bizarre 3D platformer with just, ​ ​​
​​​ ​the worst controls ever conceived.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I have no idea what my objective is, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I have no idea what's going on.​ ​​
​​​ ​Dino: Speedboat, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's a speedboating game featuring Dino!​ ​​ ​​​ ​What else do you WANT FROM ME?!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Elf: Crazy Adventures, a​ ​​
​​​ ​really, really basic 2D platformer.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Evolver, it's a nautical themed match-three game.​ ​​
​​​ ​This game is just called Farm, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​uh, it's like a farm management game.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And, uh, I had so much fun with this one that I​ ​​
​​​ ​accidentally played it for like, 30 full minutes ​ ​​ ​​​ ​while I was recording.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I am absolutely going to play this on my own time, ​ ​​
​​​ ​it was so much fun.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Farm 2 blooms the scope too much,​ ​​ ​​​ ​they made it way too overly complicated ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it didn't vibe with me.​ ​​
​​​ ​Fire & Forget is a really cool combat racing game​ ​​ ​​​ ​where you blow up these big robots ​ ​​
​​​ ​and then you can switch to like, a flying mode​ ​​ ​​​ ​and you can fly your car around!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Agh, so fun! The graphics are beautiful...​ ​​
​​​ ​Weirdly, I have not ever seen a video game do ​ ​​ ​​​ ​what this game is trying to do.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's like, weirdly original for this collection. ​ ​​
​​​ ​Highly recommended.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Gas Station is one of those mobile game ​ ​​ ​​​ ​kinda gas station management games.​ ​​
​​​ ​Not really my cup of tea.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Gods vs Humans, it's like a god game ​ ​​ ​​​ ​where you use like, divine powers to blow people up.​ ​​
​​​ ​It's kinda fun.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Hot Farm Africa is another sequel to Farm,​ ​​ ​​​ ​which, I'm- I'm sorry for being old school, ​ ​​
​​​ ​I just think Farm 1 is the best.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I think this one's also very overly complicated, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it- it takes away from it for me.​ ​​
​​​ ​The Hunchback of Notre Dame, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's a very generic 2D platformer​ ​​ ​​​ ​featuringgg that guyy...​ ​​
​​​ ​Helicopter Simulator, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I tried every button on the keyboard​ ​​ ​​​ ​and I swear, I could not get this thing off the ground.​ ​​
​​​ ​Karate Panda, it's a very generic 2D platformer.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Potentially based on ​ ​​ ​​​ ​a very similarly named animated movie.​ ​​
​​​ ​Featuring the Minecraft Movie guy.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Little Ghost, another very, very generic 2D platformer.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Kroc 'n Roll, it's a 3D platformer ​ ​​
​​​ ​where you shoot musical notes at people as an attack?​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's very weird, I kinda like it.​ ​​
​​​ ​(chuckle)​ ​​ ​​​ ​Little Folk of Faery, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's like a management game for fantasy creatures?​ ​​ ​​​ ​Magic Solitaire,​ ​​
​​​ ​I really expected this to be Klondike solitaire, but it's not.​ ​​ ​​​ ​It's... I guess one of the ​ ​​ ​​​ ​1000 unique solitaire games from the other disk​ ​​
​​​ ​because I have no idea what's going on.​ ​​ ​​​ ​MegaRace is a DOS game from 1993 running in DOSBox!​ ​​
​​​ ​Genuinely based, more of this please.​ ​​ ​​​ ​MegaRace 2 is also a DOS game from 1996, ​ ​​
​​​ ​and it's also running in DOSBox.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This game looks so nice for the time!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Oh my god- I assume the background is prerendered,​ ​​
​​​ ​and they're doing some kind of trickery with ​ ​​ ​​​ ​the cars in front, but​ ​​ ​​​ ​man, it looks SO nice!​ ​​ ​​​ ​My Doll 3D, uh, it's a dressup game,​ ​​
​​​ ​and that's it. That's the whole thing.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Pinocchio, another very generic 2D platformer.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Wow, this art looks really, really, really ugly.​ ​​
​​​ ​I'm shocked.​ ​​ ​​​ ​PIrates vs. Corsairs,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's like a turn-based strategy game ​ ​​ ​​​ ​where you play as pirates ​ ​​
​​​ ​and you try to blow up your enemies (>:3)​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it's awesome!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Also, while I'm editing, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I noticed that some of the games are like, cropped?​ ​​
​​​ ​I don't know why the capture captured them that way, sorry.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Open Kart, it's like a kart racing game.​ ​​
​​​ ​There's nothing really remotely interesting about it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Police: Destruction Street,​ ​​ ​​​ ​uh, you play as a car with like, ​ ​​
​​​ ​a gun hanging out one window and​ ​​ ​​​ ​I kinda like what it's trying to put it down here, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​but it's way too hectic and hard to keep up with​ ​​
​​​ ​and everything's way too fast, and very overwhelming.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I love the concept, I like the style, ​ ​​
​​​ ​I think the controls are pretty good too​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's just way too fast.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I was often just like, slowing my car down ​ ​​
​​​ ​so that I could take in all the information ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that it was throwing at me.​ ​​ ​​​ ​But yeah, Police: Destruction Street, love the idea.​ ​​
​​​ ​Definitely worth givin' it a try!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Reindeer Adventure*,​ ​​ ​​​ ​I'm not sure why it's stuttering like that visually, ​ ​​
​​​ ​uh, it wasn't like that on my screen.​ ​​ ​​​ ​I think it's a bug with the capture, but yeah.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Very generic Christmas themed platformer.​ ​​
​​​ ​Pony World 2, it's like a dating sim ​ ​​ ​​​ ​where your objective is to get married and have a baby.​ ​​
​​​ ​Um, it was very weird and it made me laugh a lot.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Safari Adventures,​ ​​ ​​​ ​look I'm not gonna lie to you, ​ ​​
​​​ ​I didn't even get to the gameplay in this game.​ ​​ ​​​ ​You can't skip this dude talking, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and he talked for like seven minutes straight​ ​​
​​​ ​and then I just closed the game.​ ​​ ​​​ ​This game is just called Santa Claus ​ ​​ ​​​ ​and it's a Santa Claus 2D platformer.​ ​​
​​​ ​Uuughhhhh--​ ​​ ​​​ ​Save the Furries, it's a game that's kinda like Lemmings ​ ​​ ​​​ ​but with like, physics objects?​ ​​
​​​ ​It was kinda fun.​ ​​ ​​​ ​The Secret of Nautilus, it's like an escape room game​ ​​ ​​​ ​where you have to look around, and like, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​find the key and unlock the door.​ ​​
​​​ ​It's kinda cool actually.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Shadomania,​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's some kind of puzzle game. ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I- I didn't really get it.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Sweet Home Pets,​ ​​
​​​ ​uh, it's a 2D platformerr.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And you're collecting the same exact collectibles ​ ​​
​​​ ​as the Elf 2D platformer from the beginning!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Vanilla & Chocolate, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​it's like a weirdly detailed ice cream store management game.​ ​​
​​​ ​I would've played Warm Up! but it didn't work, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​it just kept crashing.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And Trucker, where you drive a truck real fast.​ ​​
​​​ ​And y'shift gears to go even faster.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Yeeeeahhh.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Ernest Colt: Western Shooter,​ ​​
​​​ ​um, it's just like a shoot-em-up game ​ ​​ ​​​ ​where you just walk forward and shoot skunks and foxes.​ ​​
​​​ ​I'm disappointed because a game called "Western Shooter",​ ​​ ​​​ ​I thought it was gonna be like a first person shooter ​ ​​ ​​​ ​that was like, cowboy themed​ ​​
​​​ ​That woulda rocked, but no!​ ​​ ​​​ ​We just get this garbage!​ ​​ ​​​ ​Well, that's all the games off of ​ ​​ ​​​ ​the Big World of Games CD-ROM set.​ ​​
bye
​​​ ​There were a couple that I excluded, like Sudoku?​ ​​ ​​​ ​I don't really care to play Sudoku on a video.​ ​​
​​​ ​Every CD-ROM that I mentioned in this video, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​I have dumped and put on my archive.org page.​ ​​
​​​ ​So, if you wanna download ​ ​​ ​​​ ​any of the CD-ROMs that I featured here, ​ ​​ ​​​ ​you absolutely can.​ ​​ ​​​ ​And I think a lot of these were actually ​ ​​
​​​ ​previously undumped.​ ​​ ​​​ ​So, that's a big plus one for data preservation.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Sorry, my voice is so hoarse ​ ​​ ​​​ ​because I have done nothing but record VO​ ​​
​​​ ​for the past three days.​ ​​ ​​​ ​patreon.com/clue , ​ ​​ ​​​ ​thank you to everyone that supports me on there.​ ​​ ​​​ ​Thank you to everyone who sent stuff to my P.O. box, ​ ​​
