# Event-Driven Architecture: Complete Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan to transform the codebase into a fully event-driven architecture using the EventBus. The goal is to **separate data from logic** by having components publish events when state changes occur, and having other components subscribe to react to those changes - rather than having tight coupling through direct method calls.

**Core Principle**: "Don't call me, I'll call you" - Components should announce what happened (events), not dictate what should happen next (direct calls).

---

## Current Status

### âœ… Phase 4.1 Complete: Program Launching
- StartMenuState publishes `launch_program` events
- DesktopState subscribes and handles program launching
- Successfully decoupled Start Menu from Desktop

### Problems This Solves
- Start Menu no longer needs to know about DesktopState
- Multiple subscribers can react to program launches (e.g., analytics, logging)
- Easier to test Start Menu in isolation

---

## Architecture Philosophy

### Before: Tight Coupling (Bad)
```lua
-- Component A directly calls Component B
function StartMenuState:onProgramClick(program_id)
    self.host.launchProgram(program_id)  -- Tight coupling to host
end
```

**Problems**:
- Component A must know about Component B's API
- Hard to test Component A without Component B
- Can't add new behaviors without modifying Component A
- Circular dependencies common

### After: Event-Driven (Good)
```lua
-- Component A publishes an event (announces what happened)
function StartMenuState:onProgramClick(program_id)
    self.event_bus:publish('program_requested', program_id)
end

-- Component B subscribes (reacts to what happened)
function DesktopState:init(di)
    di.eventBus:subscribe('program_requested', function(program_id)
        self:launchProgram(program_id)
    end)
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Components are decoupled
- Easy to test with mock EventBus
- Add new behaviors by adding subscribers
- No circular dependencies

## Refactoring Roadmap

### Phase 4.2: Window Management Events

**Current Problem**: Direct coupling between window operations and state management

#### Events to Add:
```lua
-- Window lifecycle
'window_opened'          -- (window_id, program_id)
'window_closed'          -- (window_id)
'window_focused'         -- (window_id)
'window_minimized'       -- (window_id)
'window_restored'        -- (window_id)
'window_moved'           -- (window_id, x, y)
'window_resized'         -- (window_id, width, height)

-- Window interactions
'window_drag_started'    -- (window_id)
'window_drag_ended'      -- (window_id)
```

#### Files to Modify:
1. **WindowController** (`src/controllers/window_controller.lua`)
   - Replace direct WindowManager calls with events
   - Publish events when windows are created, closed, focused, etc.

2. **WindowManager** (`src/models/window_manager.lua`)
   - Subscribe to window events
   - Handle actual window state changes
   - Publish events when internal state changes

3. **DesktopState** (`src/states/desktop_state.lua`)
   - Subscribe to window events for UI updates
   - Remove direct WindowController coupling

#### Benefits:
- Can add window event logging without touching window code
- Easy to implement "recently closed windows" feature
- Analytics can track window usage patterns
- Undo/redo system could subscribe to all window events

---

### Phase 4.3: Desktop Icon Events

**Current Problem**: Desktop icons, file system, and recycle bin are tightly coupled

```lua
-- Desktop icon operations
'icon_created'           -- (program_id, x, y)
'icon_moved'             -- (program_id, old_x, old_y, new_x, new_y)
'icon_deleted'           -- (program_id)
'icon_double_clicked'    -- (program_id)
'icon_right_clicked'     -- (program_id, x, y)

-- Icon drag & drop
'icon_drag_started'      -- (program_id)
'icon_drag_ended'        -- (program_id, dropped_on_target)

---

### Phase 4.8: UI/Input Events

**Current Problem**: Input handling scattered across many components

#### Events to Add:
```lua
-- Menu events
'menu_opened'            -- (menu_type)
'menu_closed'            -- (menu_type)

- Accessibility (screen reader announces menu_item_hovered)
- UI testing (verify correct events published)

---

### Phase 4.9: Settings/Configuration Events

**Current Problem**: Settings changes don't propagate automatically

#### Events to Add:
```lua
-- Settings changes
'setting_changed'        -- (key, old_value, new_value)
'settings_saved'         -- ()
'settings_loaded'        -- ()
'settings_reset'         -- ()

---

## Event Naming Conventions

### Past Tense vs. Present Tense

**Use PAST TENSE** for events that announce something that already happened:
```lua
'window_opened'    -- Window is already open
'file_deleted'     -- File is already gone
'game_completed'   -- Game already finished
```

**Use PRESENT TENSE** for events that request an action:
```lua
'launch_program'   -- Request to launch a program
'close_window'     -- Request to close a window
```

**General Rule**: Most events should be PAST TENSE (announcing facts), not commands.

### Event Naming Pattern
```
<subject>_<verb_past_tense>
```

Examples:
- `window_closed` not `close_window`
- `icon_moved` not `move_icon`
- `game_started` not `start_game`

**Exception**: Request events can use present/imperative, but prefix with "request_":
- `request_program_launch`
- `request_window_close`

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-by-Phase Approach

1. **Start Small**: One subsystem at a time (we already did program launching)
2. **Maintain Fallbacks**: Keep old direct calls as fallback during transition
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Each phase should be fully tested before moving on
4. **Document Events**: Keep event catalog updated

### Gradual Migration Pattern

```lua
-- Step 1: Add event alongside old code
function Component:doSomething()
    -- Old way (keep for now)
    self.dependency:directMethod()

    -- New way
    if self.event_bus then
        self.event_bus:publish('something_happened')
    end
end

-- Step 2: Make dependency subscribe to event
function Dependency:init(di)
    if di.eventBus then
        di.eventBus:subscribe('something_happened', function()
            self:directMethod()
        end)
    end
end

-- Step 3: Remove old direct call after testing
function Component:doSomething()
    -- New way only
    self.event_bus:publish('something_happened')
end
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Event-Driven Testing

**Before (Hard to Test)**:
```lua
-- Must mock entire DesktopState
function test_start_menu_launches_program()
    local fake_desktop = {
        launchProgram = function(id)
            assert(id == 'test_program')
        end
    }
    local menu = StartMenuState:new(di, fake_desktop)
    menu:onProgramClick('test_program')
end
```

**After (Easy to Test)**:
```lua
-- Just verify event was published
function test_start_menu_publishes_launch_event()
    local events_published = {}
    local fake_bus = {
        publish = function(name, ...)
            table.insert(events_published, {name=name, args={...}})
        end
    }

    local di = {eventBus = fake_bus}
    local menu = StartMenuState:new(di, {})
    menu:onProgramClick('test_program')

    assert(#events_published == 1)
    assert(events_published[1].name == 'launch_program')
    assert(events_published[1].args[1] == 'test_program')
end
```

### Integration Testing
```lua
-- Test that events flow correctly
function test_program_launch_integration()
    local event_bus = EventBus:new()
    local launched = false

    -- Set up subscriber
    event_bus:subscribe('launch_program', function(program_id)
        launched = true
    end)

    -- Set up publisher
    local di = {eventBus = event_bus}
    local menu = StartMenuState:new(di, {})

    -- Trigger
    menu:onProgramClick('test_program')

    -- Verify
    assert(launched)
end
```

---

## Event Catalog

### Current Events (Implemented)
| Event Name | Parameters | Publisher | Subscribers |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `launch_program` | `program_id, ...params` | StartMenuState | DesktopState |

### Proposed Events (By Phase)

**Phase 4.2: Window Management** (8 events)
**Phase 4.3: Desktop Icons** (8 events)
**Phase 4.4: File System** (10 events)
**Phase 4.5: Launcher** (8 events)
**Phase 4.6: VM/Minigame** (12 events)
**Phase 4.7: Cheat Engine** (7 events)
**Phase 4.8: UI/Input** (11 events)
**Phase 4.9: Settings** (8 events)
**Phase 4.10: Save/Load** (8 events)

**Total Proposed**: ~80 events across all phases

---

## Benefits Summary

### Code Quality
- âœ… **Decoupling**: Components don't know about each other
- âœ… **Single Responsibility**: Each component does one thing
- âœ… **Open/Closed**: Add features without modifying existing code
- âœ… **Testability**: Mock EventBus instead of entire systems

### Features
- âœ… **Undo/Redo**: Subscribe to all state-changing events
- âœ… **Analytics**: One subscriber tracks everything
- âœ… **Logging**: Debug by logging all events
- âœ… **Replay**: Record events, replay later
- âœ… **Networking**: Sync events across network (future multiplayer?)

### Maintenance
- âœ… **Easier Debugging**: See all events in one place
- âœ… **Clear Data Flow**: Events show what happened when
- âœ… **Less Coupling**: Changing one component doesn't break others
- âœ… **Documentation**: Event catalog documents system behavior

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance
**Concern**: Publishing many events might slow down the game

**Mitigation**:
- Events are very fast (just function calls)
- Only publish significant events, not every frame update
- Batch events if needed (`publish_batch(['event1', 'event2'])`)

### Risk 2: Debugging Complexity
**Concern**: Hard to trace event flow

**Mitigation**:
- Add EventBus debug mode that logs all events
- Use descriptive event names
- Maintain event catalog documentation
- Dev tools to visualize event flow

### Risk 3: Event Order Dependencies
**Concern**: Subscribers might depend on event order

**Mitigation**:
- Document that event order is not guaranteed
- Use explicit sequencing if needed (`event_bus:publish_ordered()`)
- Avoid inter-subscriber dependencies

### Risk 4: Migration Effort
**Concern**: Too much work to refactor everything

**Mitigation**:
- Gradual migration (keep old code as fallback)
- One phase at a time
- Prioritize high-value refactorings first
- Skip low-value areas

---

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Do First)
1. âœ… **Phase 4.1: Program Launching** - DONE
2. **Phase 4.2: Window Management** - High coupling, used everywhere
3. **Phase 4.4: File System** - Central to many features
4. **Phase 4.10: Save/Load** - Enables many quality-of-life features

### Medium Priority (Do Second)
5. **Phase 4.3: Desktop Icons** - Nice UI improvements
6. **Phase 4.6: VM/Minigame** - Enables cool features like replay
7. **Phase 4.9: Settings** - Quality of life

### Lower Priority (Do If Time)
8. **Phase 4.5: Launcher** - Already fairly isolated
9. **Phase 4.7: Cheat Engine** - Niche feature
10. **Phase 4.8: UI/Input** - More polish than structure

---

## Conclusion

Event-driven architecture is a powerful pattern that will make this codebase more maintainable, testable, and extensible. By gradually migrating to events, we can:

1. **Separate concerns**: Data models don't know about UI, UI doesn't know about business logic
2. **Enable features**: Undo/redo, analytics, replays become trivial
3. **Improve testing**: Mock EventBus instead of entire dependency trees
4. **Reduce coupling**: Add features without modifying existing code

The migration can be done gradually, one phase at a time, with fallbacks to ensure nothing breaks.

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix the program launching bug (variadic args)
2. Start Phase 4.2 (Window Management)
3. Update this document as patterns emerge
4. Maintain event catalog
