# Phase 4.5: Launcher/Shop Events - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 4.5 (Launcher/Shop Events) by adding event publishing to all launcher and shop operations. LauncherState now announces all user interactions and game purchases via events.

---

## Events Implemented

### Game Purchasing (3 events)
- `game_purchased` - Published when user successfully purchases a game (game_id, cost)
- `purchase_failed` - Published when purchase fails (game_id, reason)
- `game_unlocked` - Published when a game is unlocked (game_id)

### Game Launching (1 event)
- `game_launch_requested` - Published when user tries to launch a game (game_id)

### Shop Interactions (3 events)
- `shop_opened` - Published when launcher/shop window opens
- `shop_category_changed` - Published when user changes category filter (category)
- `game_details_viewed` - Published when user views game details (game_id)

**Total**: 7 events

---

## Files Modified

### 1. src/states/launcher_state.lua
**Changes**:
- Added `event_bus` reference from DI (line 12)
- Added event publishing to:
  - `enter()` - Publishes `shop_opened`
  - `updateFilter()` - Publishes `shop_category_changed`
  - `launchGame()` - Publishes `game_launch_requested`
  - `showUnlockPrompt()` - Publishes `game_purchased`, `game_unlocked`, `purchase_failed`
  - `showGameDetails()` - Publishes `game_details_viewed`

**Lines Changed**: ~25

---

## Architecture Notes

### Already Event-Driven!

LauncherState was already well-architected:
- Returns events to DesktopState instead of calling state_machine directly
- Doesn't directly manipulate PlayerData (calls methods, but doesn't bypass encapsulation)
- Clean separation between UI (LauncherView) and logic (LauncherState)

**Result**: Zero fallback calls to remove! ðŸŽ‰

### Event Flow Example

```
User clicks "Unlock" button
  â†’ LauncherState:showUnlockPrompt()
    â†’ PlayerData:spendTokens() (model method)
    â†’ PlayerData:unlockGame() (model method)
    â†’ Publishes 'game_purchased' event
    â†’ Publishes 'game_unlocked' event
      â†’ (Future) Statistics subscribes and tracks purchase
      â†’ (Future) Achievement system subscribes
      â†’ (Future) Tutorial subscribes and shows tips
```

---

## No Fallback Calls to Remove

Like Phase 4.4, Phase 4.5 had **zero fallback calls** to remove because:

1. **LauncherState already returns events** - Uses `return { type = "event", name = "launch_minigame" }`
2. **Clean model interaction** - Calls PlayerData methods, doesn't bypass them
3. **Event publishing is additive** - We added events, didn't replace fallbacks

This confirms LauncherState was already well-designed!

---

## Events Not Yet Subscribed

The following events are published but not yet subscribed to (ready for future features):

- `game_purchased` - Future: Track purchase history, achievements
- `purchase_failed` - Future: Analytics, user experience improvements
- `game_unlocked` - Future: Show celebration animation, tutorial tips
- `game_launch_requested` - Future: Track game play frequency
- `shop_opened` - Future: Show onboarding tips, track engagement
- `shop_category_changed` - Future: Track user preferences
- `game_details_viewed` - Future: Analytics, recommendation system

These events are in place and ready for future subscribers without modifying LauncherState.

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Open Launcher**:
   - Double-click "Game Collection" icon on desktop
   - âœ… Verify launcher opens
   - âœ… Verify `shop_opened` event published

2. **Change Category**:
   - Click different category tabs (All, Action, Puzzle, Locked, etc.)
   - âœ… Verify games filter correctly
   - âœ… Verify `shop_category_changed` event published for each change

3. **View Game Details**:
   - Click on a game in the list
   - âœ… Verify detail panel opens on right
   - âœ… Verify `game_details_viewed` event published

4. **Purchase a Game**:
   - Click "Play" on a locked game
   - Click "Unlock" in the prompt
   - âœ… Verify tokens are spent
   - âœ… Verify game becomes unlocked
   - âœ… Verify `game_purchased` and `game_unlocked` events published

5. **Purchase Failed**:
   - Try to unlock a game without enough tokens
   - âœ… Verify error message shows
   - âœ… Verify `purchase_failed` event published

6. **Launch a Game**:
   - Click "Play" on an unlocked game
   - âœ… Verify game launches in VM
   - âœ… Verify `game_launch_requested` event published
