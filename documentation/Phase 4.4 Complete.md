# Phase 4.4: File System Events - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 4.4 (File System Events) by adding event publishing to all file system operations. FileSystem is now a pure data model that publishes events for all changes.

---

## Events Implemented

### File/Folder Operations (4 events)
- `folder_created` - Published when a folder is created
- `file_moved` - Published when a file/folder is moved
- `file_deleted` - Published when a file/folder is deleted
- `file_restored` - Published when a file/folder is restored from FS recycle bin

### Recycle Bin Operations (1 event)
- `recycle_bin_emptied` - Published when FS recycle bin is emptied

**Total**: 5 events

---

## Files Modified

### 1. src/models/file_system.lua
**Changes**:
- Added DI parameter to `init()` method
- Stored `event_bus` reference from DI
- Added event publishing to:
  - `createFolder()` - Publishes `folder_created`
  - `moveEntry()` - Publishes `file_moved`
  - `deleteEntry()` - Publishes `file_deleted`
  - `restoreDeletedEntry()` - Publishes `file_restored`
  - `emptyFsRecycleBin()` - Publishes `recycle_bin_emptied`

**Lines Changed**: ~15

### 2. main.lua
**Changes**:
- Updated `FileSystem:new()` to `FileSystem:new(di)` on line 102
- Passes DI container with EventBus to FileSystem

**Lines Changed**: 1

## Architecture Notes

### Pure Data Model Pattern

FileSystem follows the pure data model pattern:
1. **No side effects** - Just updates internal data structure
2. **Event publishing** - Announces changes via EventBus
3. **No subscribers** - Doesn't listen to events, only publishes them
4. **Stateless operations** - Each method is independent

This makes FileSystem:
- Easy to test (mock the EventBus)
- Easy to extend (add subscribers without modifying FileSystem)
- Easy to understand (single responsibility)

### Event Flow Example

```
User creates folder in File Explorer
  → FileExplorerState calls FileSystem:createFolder()
    → FileSystem creates folder in data structure
    → FileSystem publishes 'folder_created' event
      → (Future) File Explorer windows subscribe and refresh UI
      → (Future) Start Menu subscribes and updates Documents menu
      → (Future) Search indexer subscribes and indexes new folder
```

---

## No Fallback Calls to Remove

Unlike Phase 4.2 and 4.3, Phase 4.4 had **zero fallback calls** to remove because:

1. **FileSystem is already a pure model** - It doesn't call other components
2. **All operations are self-contained** - They just modify internal data
3. **Event publishing is additive** - We added events, didn't replace fallbacks

This is the ideal case for event-driven architecture!

---

## Events Not Yet Subscribed

The following events are published but not yet subscribed to (ready for future features):

- `folder_created` - Future: Auto-refresh File Explorer windows
- `file_moved` - Future: Update open windows showing moved files
- `file_deleted` - Future: Close windows showing deleted files
- `file_restored` - Future: Refresh File Explorer when files restored
- `recycle_bin_emptied` - Future: Update Recycle Bin window UI

These events are in place and ready to be used by future subscribers without modifying FileSystem again.

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create Folder**:
   - Open File Explorer
   - Right-click → New → Folder
   - ✅ Verify folder appears
   - ✅ (Future) Verify other File Explorer windows refresh

2. **Move File/Folder**:
   - Drag a file from one folder to another
   - ✅ Verify file moves correctly
   - ✅ (Future) Verify Start Menu Documents updates

3. **Delete File/Folder**:
   - Right-click file → Delete
   - ✅ Verify file disappears
   - ✅ Verify file appears in FS Recycle Bin

4. **Restore File**:
   - Open FS Recycle Bin (via File Explorer)
   - Right-click item → Restore
   - ✅ Verify file reappears in original location

5. **Empty Recycle Bin**:
   - Right-click Recycle Bin → Empty
   - ✅ Verify all items deleted permanently

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Extensibility
- Add file watchers without modifying FileSystem
- Add backup system by subscribing to all events
- Add search indexing without touching core code

### ✅ Testability
- Can test FileSystem with mock EventBus
- Can verify events published without integration tests
- Each operation is independently testable

### ✅ Maintainability
- Clear event flow
- Single responsibility (FileSystem just manages data)
- Easy to add new file operations

### ✅ Decoupling
- FileSystem doesn't know about File Explorer
- FileSystem doesn't know about Start Menu
- FileSystem doesn't know about RecycleBin (desktop icons)

## Comparison to Phase 4.2/4.3

| Aspect | Phase 4.2/4.3 | Phase 4.4 |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Events Added | 29 | 5 |
| Fallbacks Removed | 17 | 0 |
| Files Modified | 4 | 2 |
| Subscribers Added | Yes (WindowManager, DesktopIcons) | No (ready for future) |
| Complexity | High (many publishers & subscribers) | Low (publish-only) |

Phase 4.4 was much simpler because FileSystem was already well-architected as a data model.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
- Add FileExplorerState subscribers to refresh UI when files change
- Add StartMenuState subscribers to update Documents menu

### Future Phases
- **Phase 4.5**: Launcher/Shop Events
- **Phase 4.6**: VM/Minigame Events
- **Phase 4.7**: Cheat Engine Events
- **Phase 4.8**: UI/Input Events
- **Phase 4.9**: Settings Events
- **Phase 4.10**: Save/Load Events

---

## Metrics

### Code Changes
- **Files Modified**: 2
- **Events Implemented**: 5
- **Lines Changed**: ~16
- **Fallbacks Removed**: 0
- **Time to Complete**: ~15 minutes

### Event Catalog
**Total Events Across All Phases**:
- Phase 4.1: Program Launching (1 event)
- Phase 4.2: Window Management (18 events)
- Phase 4.3: Desktop Icons (11 events)
- Phase 4.4: File System (5 events)
- **Grand Total**: 35 events ✅

---

## Conclusion

Phase 4.4 is **COMPLETE** ✅

All file system operations now publish events. The FileSystem model is a pure data model with zero coupling to other components. Ready for future subscribers to react to file changes without modifying FileSystem.
