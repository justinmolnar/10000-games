**The "official" company website for the 10,000 Games Collection**

- **community.html** - Forum posts (all sound similar, AI-generated feel)

## Narrative Integration

### Obvious Surface Layer
Players browsing normally see:
- Helpful gaming websites
- Strategy guides
- Company information
- Community discussions
- Pretty standard 90s web content

### Slightly Off Details
Players who notice patterns see:
- All pages have AUTO-GENERATED timestamps
- Dave's email uses company domain
- Shop knows token count somehow
- Email replies unavailable everywhere
- Community posts all sound similar
- Updates for CD-ROM software
- Everything feels slightly automated

### Deep Lore Discovery
Players who cross-reference files find:
- Webpage backgrounds match files in `C:\SYSTEM\WEB\`
- Text matches templates in `C:\SYSTEM\MAIL\`
- Timestamps align with generation logs
- "Dave" might not be a real person
- Everything was generated by the system
- No human developers involved

### The Realization
- There is no MegaGames Inc. company
- There is no Dave
- There are no other players (forum posts are generated)
- The website is dynamically created by the AI
- It's all automated systems talking to themselves
- You're the only real human in the loop

## Technical Notes

### URL Resolution
All domains map to `assets/data/web/[folder]/` filesystem paths.

Default domain: `www.megagamesinc.com`

### Navigation
- Links use relative paths within same domain
- Cross-domain links use full URLs
- Browser handles .html extension automatically
- 404.html shown for missing pages

### AUTO-GENERATED Comments
Every page has timestamp comment like:
```html
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: 1999-08-15 14:23:42 -->
```

Purpose: Environmental storytelling - pages weren't hand-crafted by humans.

### Writing Style
All pages use:
- Slightly formulaic language
- Optimization-focused terminology
- Similar sentence structures
- Consistent enthusiasm
- AI-generated feel (intentional)

But plausible enough to ignore if not looking closely.

## Future Expansion

Easy to add more pages:
1. Create HTML file in appropriate `assets/data/web/[domain]/` folder
2. Add domain to `url_resolver.lua` domain_map if new domain
3. Link from existing pages or use as standalone URL

Suggested additions:
- Game-specific strategy pages
- More "personal" player sites
- Forum threads
- Download pages
- Achievement galleries
- Leaderboards (all fake entries)

Keep the pattern:
- AUTO-GENERATED timestamps
- Slightly off language
- Cross-reference potential with filesystem
- Optimization/efficiency focus
- Helpful but uncanny
