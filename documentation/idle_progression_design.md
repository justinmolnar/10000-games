# Idle Progression Design: From Active Play to Automation Empire

## Core Philosophy

This is a game about **discovery, optimization, and scaling**. It respects player time by creating a clear arc from active engagement to passive automation, with skill expression at every stage. The collection of 1000+ games isn't just content bloat - each variant is a potential optimization puzzle that directly translates to power in Space Defender.

**Target playtime:** 8-10 hours to complete all content

---

## The Bullet System: Your Arsenal IS Your Collection

**How bullets work:**
- Every completed game becomes a bullet type in Space Defender
- That bullet's damage = the token payout from your best performance
- Space Defender fires ALL your completed games as a barrage

**Example early game:**
- Completed 5 games with performances: 55%, 68%, 72%, 81%, 64%
- Token payouts: 45, 120, 180, 350, 95
- **Your bullet arsenal:** 45dmg, 120dmg, 180dmg, 350dmg, 95dmg
- Total damage per volley: 790
- Fire rate: 2 bullets/sec → ~1,580 DPS

**Space Defender as a gate:**
- Level 1 boss: 50,000 HP
- Your 1,580 DPS = 31 seconds to kill
- Boss kills you in 45 seconds
- **You can beat it, but barely**

**The realization:**
- "I need stronger bullets to progress"
- "Stronger bullets = higher token payouts"
- "Higher payouts = better performance + game optimization + more completions"
- "The minigames aren't just grinding... they're literally my weapon upgrades"

---

## Hour 0-2: Active Grinding & Building Your First Arsenal

**What you're doing:** Playing games manually, each completion adds a new bullet

**The early loop:**
- Start with 500 tokens
- Unlock "Dodge Master" (Clone 0) for 100 tokens
- Play it manually - WASD to dodge, need 30 dodges to win
- Complete it with 68% performance → earn 120 tokens
- **Bullet unlocked: Dodge Master - 120 damage**

- Try Space Defender Level 1
- You have ONE bullet: 120 damage
- Boss has 50,000 HP
- 120 damage × 2 shots/sec = 240 DPS
- Need 208 seconds (3.5 minutes) to kill
- Boss kills you in 45 seconds
- **"I need more bullets"**

**Building the arsenal:**
- Unlock and complete more games:
  - Dodge Deluxe: 62% performance → 95 tokens → 95dmg bullet
  - Dodge Ice Rink: 71% performance → 180 tokens → 180dmg bullet
  - Dodge Tiny Arena: 55% performance → 75 tokens → 75dmg bullet
  - Dodge Tactical Dash: 78% performance → 280 tokens → 280dmg bullet

- Arsenal now: 120, 95, 180, 75, 280 = **750 total damage per volley**
- DPS: 750 × 2 = **1,500 DPS**
- Time to kill Level 1 boss: 33 seconds
- **Still possible, but tight**

**The performance matters:**
- You notice: better performance = more tokens = stronger bullet
- Replay Dodge Master, get 82% this time → 280 tokens
- **Dodge Master bullet upgraded: 120 → 280 damage**
- Your arsenal just got 160 damage stronger from ONE replay
- "Oh shit, I can upgrade my bullets by playing better"

**The grind wall:**
- You've completed 12 games, total arsenal damage: ~2,400
- DPS: 4,800
- Space Defender Level 1: Clearable in 10 seconds (boss 50K HP)
- Space Defender Level 2: Boss has 500,000 HP
- Need 104 seconds to kill at current DPS
- Boss kills you in 60 seconds
- **Hard gate. You literally cannot progress.**

- Complete with 91% performance (way better!)
- Token payout: 520 tokens (650 with multiplier)
- **Dodge Master bullet upgraded: 350 → 650 damage**
- "Holy shit, my bullet just got 300 damage stronger"

**The optimization cascade:**
- You realize: optimize games → replay for better performance → stronger bullets
- Go through your 12 completed games
- Optimize the ones with low payouts (the 75dmg and 95dmg bullets)
- Replay them, improve performance, boost their damage
- Arsenal before: ~3,000 total damage (4,800 DPS with multiplier)
- Arsenal after: ~6,500 total damage (10,400 DPS)

**Space Defender Level 2:**
- Boss: 500,000 HP

---

## Hour 4-6: Arsenal Expansion & Hidden Gems

**The mid-game loop:**
- Complete more games → more bullets → higher DPS
- Optimize completed games → stronger individual bullets
- Beat Space Defender levels → universal multipliers make everything stronger

**Arsenal building strategy:**
- You have 25 games completed now
- Total arsenal damage: ~15,000 per volley
- But some bullets are trash: 50dmg, 85dmg, 120dmg (early completions, bad performance)
- Some bullets are monsters: 1,200dmg, 1,800dmg, 2,500dmg (optimized, good performance)

**CheatEngine budget expansion:**
- Save up tokens, upgrade budget: 500 → 1,000 → 2,500 → 5,000
- With 5,000 budget, you can now afford:
  - Change victory_condition to "time" (5,000 credits)
  - Reduce victory_limit to 10 seconds
  - Add 10 lives (1,000 credits)
  - Total: Game completes in 10 seconds, virtually impossible to lose

**The hidden gem hunt:**
- Some games have naturally high token payouts (complex formulas, multipliers in JSON)
- Clone 36 (Shield Tank):
  - Base payout at 70% performance: 850 tokens
  - Optimize with 2,500 credits: lives +5, shield +3, victory_limit -10
  - Replay at 94% performance: 1,950 tokens (2,440 with multipliers)
  - **One bullet doing 2,440 damage!**

- Clone 46 (Speed Trial):
  - Has score_multiplier_mode: "speed" (bonus payout for high speed)
  - Optimize: Increase max_speed, reduce victory time to 15 seconds
  - Replay at 88% performance with speed bonus: 3,100 tokens (3,875 with multipliers)
  - **3,875 damage from one game!**

**The collection exploration:**
- You start hunting for games with:
  - High base payouts (good formulas)
  - Modifiers that boost scoring (score_multiplier_mode, difficulty_modifier)
  - Easy-to-optimize parameters (lives, victory_condition)
- "Dodge Fog Runner has time-based victory AND player_trail_length for score bonus..."
- "Dodge Gravity Well has massive lives (8) and shields (1) by default, easy to boost..."
- Each discovery feels like finding treasure

**Arsenal state:**
- 40 games completed
- Total damage: ~85,000 per volley
- DPS: 170,000
- Space Defender Level 4 boss: 5,000,000 HP = 29 seconds to kill
- You're crushing it

**Level 4 rewards:**
- +100% universal multiplier (now 2.75x total)
- Unlock: Multi-Window Controller (5,000 tokens)
- Unlock: Virtual Machine #1 (15,000 tokens)

---

## Hour 10-16: VM Automation & Passive Arsenal Scaling

**Virtual Machines unlocked:**
- VM window on desktop: "VM-1: IDLE"
- Right-click any completed game → "Assign to VM-1"
- Assign your best optimized game: Clone 46 (Speed Trial) - 5,200 damage bullet, 12 second completion

**How VMs work:**
- VM simulates playing the game automatically
- Uses your best performance as baseline × VM efficiency (starts at 80%)
- Runs in background continuously
- **Tokens earned passively**, no input required

**VM-1 running:**
- Game: Speed Trial (5,200 damage bullet)
- VM efficiency: 80%
- Token payout: 5,200 × 0.8 = 4,160 tokens per completion
- Completion time: 12 seconds × 1.2 (VM speed penalty) = 14.4 seconds
- **Passive income: ~17,280 tokens per minute**

**The passive layer:**
- Unlock 5 VMs, assign your 5 best optimized games
- Each VM running a 3,000-6,000 damage bullet game
- Passive income: ~85,000 tokens per minute
- "I'm earning tokens while playing other games"
- "I'm earning tokens while optimizing CheatEngine"
- "I'm earning tokens while playing Space Defender"

**VM optimization:**
- Upgrade VM Speed: 1.2x penalty → 1.0x → 0.8x (VMs complete faster than you!)
- Upgrade VM Efficiency: 80% → 90% → 100% → 110% (VMs perform better than you!)
- Upgrade VM Stability: 5% crash rate → 1% → 0.1% → 0% (never fails)
- At max upgrades: VMs complete games at 0.8× time with 110% performance
- **Your 5,200 damage bullet becomes 5,720 in a VM at 9.6 second completion**

**Scaling VMs:**
- Unlock more VM slots: 5 → 10 → 25 → 50
- Assign more optimized games
- 50 VMs running = 50 games completing every 10-15 seconds
- Passive income: ~2,000,000 tokens per minute

**The synergy:**
- **Active:** Multi-window farming teams (10 games simultaneously) = 60,000-100,000 tokens/min
- **Passive:** 50 VMs running optimized games = 2,000,000 tokens/min
- **Total:** ~2,100,000 tokens/min
- "The VMs do the heavy lifting, I just optimize and occasionally farm actively for fun"

**Arsenal state:**
- 300 games completed
- Total damage per volley: ~3,500,000 (mix of weak early bullets and optimized monsters)
- But you have 50 "god-tier" bullets: 10,000-50,000 damage each
- DPS: 7,000,000

**Space Defender Level 10:**
- Boss: 500,000,000 HP
- Your DPS: 7,000,000
- Time to kill: 71 seconds
- Boss kills you in 120 seconds
- **You beat it, but it's getting harder**

**Level 10 rewards:**
- +500% universal multiplier (now 9.75x total!)
- Unlock: VM Multi-Instance (each VM can run multiple games)
- Unlock: CheatEngine Budget → 100,000 capacity
- Unlock: Space Defender Auto-Dodge (passive dodging, reduces active attention needed)

## Automation Systems Deep Dive

### Multi-Window Controller

**Basic functionality:**
- Upgrade: "Multi-Window Controller" (cost: 5,000 tokens)
- Your keyboard/mouse inputs broadcast to ALL open game windows simultaneously
- Works best with games that have compatible control schemes

**Synergy groups:**
- **Default Movement Team:** All games with `movement_type: "default"` - WASD direct movement
- **Asteroids Flight Wing:** All games with `movement_type: "asteroids"` - rotation + thrust
- **Jump Squad:** All games with `movement_type: "jump"` - teleport/dash mechanics

**Upgrade path:**
- **Multi-Window Basic:** Control up to 5 windows (5,000 tokens)
- **Multi-Window Pro:** Control up to 10 windows (25,000 tokens)
- **Multi-Window Elite:** Control up to 15 windows (100,000 tokens)
- **Datacenter Mode:** Control up to 25 windows (500,000 tokens)

**The optimization game:**
- Find 10 games with same movement_type
- Optimize all 10 to have fast victory conditions (10-20 seconds)
- Optimize all 10 to have high lives (forgiving, consistent)
- Multi-box them: play once, earn 10x rewards

**Example farming session:**
```
Team: Default-Speed (10 games, all default WASD, all 5-10 second completions)
- Clone 0 (Dodge Master): 15,000 dmg bullet, 8 sec completion
- Clone 2 (Ice Rink): 12,000 dmg bullet, 10 sec completion
- Clone 5 (Tiny Arena): 18,000 dmg bullet, 7 sec completion
- Clone 6 (Momentum Master): 14,000 dmg bullet, 9 sec completion
- Clone 22 (One Strike): 20,000 dmg bullet, 5 sec completion
- Clone 27 (Speed Demon): 25,000 dmg bullet, 6 sec completion
- Clone 35 (Fog Runner): 16,000 dmg bullet, 8 sec completion
- Clone 37 (Wind Dancer): 19,000 dmg bullet, 7 sec completion
- Clone 46 (Speed Trial): 22,000 dmg bullet, 10 sec completion
- Clone 49 (Fortress Defense): 13,000 dmg bullet, 9 sec completion

Total tokens per run: 174,000
Run time: ~12 seconds (wait for slowest to complete)
Tokens per minute: 870,000
```

### Virtual Machines (VMs)

**Basic functionality:**
- Unlock VM slots through Space Defender progression
- Assign completed games to VMs
- VMs auto-play games in background using **demo recording/playback**
- Generates tokens passively, no player input required

**How VMs actually work:**
1. Play a game and record a demo (exact keypresses + timestamps)
2. Assign game + demo to VM
3. VM runs the demo 10-100 times rapidly in background (fast-forward or parallel)
4. Calculates average: "8.2 sec completion, 520 tokens avg, 87% success rate"
5. VM now generates tokens at that rate: `(520 × 0.87) / 8.2 = 55 tokens/sec`
6. Re-runs tests periodically to update average
7. UI shows ONE game window as visual representation

**Why this matters:**
- **Early game:** Your demos are basic, success rate is low (60-70%)
  - Manual play is MORE efficient than VMs
  - VMs feel unreliable, inconsistent
  - "Maybe I'll use these later..."

- **Mid game:** CheatEngine optimizations make demos more reliable (85-90%)
  - Add 20 lives = hard to fail even with mediocre demo
  - Reduce victory condition = less time for RNG to kill you
  - VMs becoming competitive with manual play

- **Late game:** Perfect optimizations + conservative demos = 99%+ success
  - Lives: 50, victory: 5 seconds, obstacles: 20%, player_size: 0.3
  - Demo strategy: "Just stay still in center, don't move"
  - VM success rate: 99.8% (engineered to be impossible to fail)
  - **VMs now superior to manual play** - you've automated yourself

**Natural progression curve:**
- Active play rewarded early (VMs unreliable without optimization)
- Optimization makes VMs viable (engineering "VM-friendly" games)
- Automation dominant late (perfectly engineered games + safe demos)

**VM progression (via demo quality):**
- **Basic:** No optimization, raw skill demo
  - Success rate: 60-70% on average games
  - Manual play still better

- **CheatEngine Tier 1:** Budget 5,000, basic optimizations
  - Lives +10, victory_limit -10
  - Success rate: 80-85% (more forgiving)

- **CheatEngine Tier 2:** Budget 25,000, serious optimizations
  - Lives +20, victory_limit -50%, change victory_condition
  - Success rate: 90-95% (hard to fail)

- **CheatEngine Tier 3:** Budget 100,000+, perfect engineering
  - Lives +50, victory 5 seconds, tiny hitbox, minimal obstacles
  - Demo: Ultra-conservative (barely move)
  - Success rate: 99%+ (impossible to fail)

**Multi-Instance:**
- VM can run multiple games simultaneously
- Each game has its own demo
- Average calculated across all assigned games
- Unlocks: 1 → 5 → 10 → 50 games per VM

**VM slot progression:**
- Start: 0 VMs
- Space Defender Level 4: Unlock 1 VM slot
- Level 6: +5 VM slots (6 total)
- Level 10: +10 VM slots (16 total)
- Level 12: +15 VM slots (31 total)
- Level 15: +20 VM slots (51 total)
- Level 18: +25 VM slots (76 total)
- Level 20: +24 VM slots (100 total)

**The VM empire:**
- Late game: 100 VMs, each running 50 games (Tier 5)
- Total processes: 5,000 games running simultaneously
- Each game completes every 3-10 seconds
- Passive income: Trillions of tokens per minute
- **You've built a token-printing datacenter**

### Completion Bonus System (NEW)

**The mechanic:**
- Every time you complete a game, that game's token payout permanently increases
- Bonus: +1% per completion (multiplicative)
- Stacks infinitely

**Example:**
```
Dodge Master (Clone 0):
- Base payout: 10,000 tokens (after optimizations and multipliers)
- Completions: 0
- Actual payout: 10,000 tokens

After 1 completion:
- Completions: 1
- Bonus: 1.01× (1% increase)
- Actual payout: 10,100 tokens

After 10 completions:
- Completions: 10
- Bonus: 1.01^10 = 1.1046× (10.46% increase)
- Actual payout: 11,046 tokens

After 50 completions:
- Completions: 50
- Bonus: 1.01^50 = 1.644× (64.4% increase)
- Actual payout: 16,440 tokens

After 100 completions:
- Completions: 100
- Bonus: 1.01^100 = 2.7048× (170% increase)
- Actual payout: 27,048 tokens

After 500 completions:
- Completions: 500
- Bonus: 1.01^500 = 144.77× (14,377% increase!!!)
- Actual payout: 1,447,700 tokens
```

**The synergy with multi-window:**
- Open 10 instances of the same game (same clone, same variant)
- Complete all 10 simultaneously in 5 seconds
- Each completion counts: Game now has +10 completions
- Bonus: 1.01^10 = 1.1046× (already 10.46% stronger)
- Next run: All 10 instances benefit from the 10.46% increase
- **Exponential scaling loop:**
  - Complete 10 → +10.46% → Complete 10 more → +21.90% → Complete 10 more → +34.39% → ...

**The farming strategy:**
- Find one perfect game: 3-second completion, 100% success rate, high base payout
- Open 25 instances (max multi-window)
- Farm it for 10 minutes: ~500 completions across all instances
- That game is now 144× stronger than it started
- **One hyper-optimized, infinitely-farmed game becomes your strongest bullet**

**The balance:**
- Encourages specialization (deep farming of specific games)
- Rewards active play (multi-window farming = rapid completions)
- Creates meta-game: "Which game should I farm to 1,000 completions?"
- VMs also benefit: If a game has 500 completions, VMs get the 144× bonus too

**Visual feedback:**
- Game list shows completion count next to each game
- "Dodge Master - 10,000 dmg | Completions: 847 | Bonus: 4,391×"
- Sort games by: Name, Damage, Completions, Bonus multiplier
- **Trophy games:** Games with 1,000+ completions get special visual flair

**The endgame fantasy:**
- You've found THE perfect game (Clone 456)
- Base payout: 50,000 tokens
- Completions: 2,000 (farmed for hours with 25-window multi-box)
- Bonus: 1.01^2000 = 3.99×10^8 (399 million multiplier!!!)
- **Actual payout: 19,950,000,000,000 tokens (19.95 trillion)**
- **Bullet damage: 19.95 trillion from ONE game**
- "I have created a god-bullet"

## Boss Games & Impossible Variants

**The concept:**
Some game variants are intentionally designed to be **impossible or nearly unbeatable** without heavy CheatEngine modification. These serve as gates that force optimization and unlock progression.

**Example Boss Game:**
```
Clone 847: "Dodge Apocalypse"
- Victory condition: dodge_count
- Victory limit: 10,000 dodges
- Lives: 1
- Obstacle spawn rate: 5.0× (insane)
- Difficulty modifier: 2.5
```

**Manually:** Would take 20+ minutes of absolutely perfect play with no mistakes. Essentially impossible.

**The CheatEngine unlock path:**

1. **First attempt (Budget: 5,000):**
   - Can afford: +20 lives, reduce spawn rate slightly
   - Still need 10,000 dodges
   - Still takes 15+ minutes
   - "This is still impossible"

2. **Mid-game attempt (Budget: 50,000):**
   - Can afford: +50 lives, spawn rate 2.0×, change some physics
   - Still need 10,000 dodges
   - Takes 10 minutes with 80% success rate
   - "Better, but not worth farming"

3. **Late-game unlock (Budget: 100,000+):**
   - **NEW UNLOCK: "Dodge Count Multiplier"** (50,000 credits)
     - Set multiplier: 100×, 500×, 1000×
     - At 1000×: Only need 10 actual dodges to count as 10,000
   - Lives: 1 → 50 (10,000 credits)
   - Spawn rate: 5.0 → 0.3 (25,000 credits)
   - Player size: 1.0 → 0.3 (15,000 credits - tiny hitbox)
   - **Total cost: 100,000 credits**

4. **Result after optimization:**
   - Complete in 8 seconds
   - 10 dodges × 1000 multiplier = victory
   - 50 lives with tiny hitbox = impossible to fail
   - Token payout: 150,000+ (boss games have massive base rewards)
   - **This "impossible" game is now a god-tier farming game**

**Other boss game mechanics:**

**Victory condition modifiers:**
- "Win Multiplier" unlock (expensive)
  - Score 100 points, but score × 100 = 10,000 effective

- "Time Compression" unlock
  - Survive 60 seconds, but time × 10 = 600 effective seconds

- "Perfect Dodge Amplifier"
  - Each perfect dodge counts as 50 normal dodges

**Why boss games work:**
- **Force CheatEngine progression:** Need high budgets to unlock multipliers
- **Create gates:** "I can't beat Clone 847 until I can afford the 100K unlock"
- **Reward optimization:** The most impossible games become the best farms
- **Satisfaction:** "Taming the beast" - turning nightmare into trivial
- **Natural difficulty curve:** Early games = beatable, late games = engineering puzzles

**Boss game rewards:**
- 5-10× higher base token payouts than normal games
- Unique unlock rewards (first completion grants special CheatEngine unlocks)
- Space Defender progression gates (need to complete X boss games to unlock Level Y)

**Design philosophy:**
- Player sees impossible game early: "What the fuck, 10,000 dodges?!"
- Player returns later with tools: "Oh, I can make dodges count 1000× now..."
- Player engineers solution: "Lives 50, multiplier 1000×, obstacles 10%"
- **Boss becomes farm:** What was impossible is now a 5-second auto-win printing billions

## Why This Works

**Bullets = Progress:**
- Every game you complete makes you stronger
- Every optimization makes you stronger
- Every replay to improve performance makes you stronger
- Every additional completion increases that game's bonus
- Direct, clear, satisfying feedback loop

**Space Defender as the gate:**
- Hard DPS checks force you to engage with the collection
- Can't just grind one game - need breadth AND depth (though endgame specialization is viable)
- Beating levels feels earned (you literally built the power to do it)
- Rewards are meaningful (universal multipliers cascade through your entire arsenal)

**Multiple progression paths:**
- **Breadth:** Complete more games → more bullets → higher total DPS
- **Depth:** Optimize fewer games deeply → god-tier individual bullets
- **Specialization:** Farm one perfect game 1,000+ times → exponential completion bonuses
- **Hybrid:** Balanced approach, optimizing as you explore

**Respects player time:**
- Active play is rewarded (multi-window = high tokens/min + rapid completion bonuses)
- Passive play is enabled (VMs = always earning)
- Late game can be "check in, optimize, let it run"
- Or go hard on active farming for massive completion bonus stacking

**The collection feels alive:**
- Every variant is a potential bullet upgrade
- Every variant is a potential farming candidate
- Hidden gems exist (high payout formulas, good modifier combos)
- Discovery moments throughout the entire game
- "Oh shit, Clone 456 has score_multiplier_mode AND high base payout AND 3-second completion potential!"
- "This is THE ONE. I'm farming this to 1,000 completions."

**Skill expression:**
- Early: Player skill in games (better performance = stronger bullets)
- Mid: Optimization skill in CheatEngine (budget allocation, parameter choices)
- Late: System design skill (arsenal building, VM loadouts, farming team composition)
- Endgame: Specialization strategy (which game to hyper-farm for completion bonuses)
- Always: Exploration and discovery

**Idle that makes sense:**
- Automation is earned through completion + optimization
- Numbers going up have clear mechanical reasons
- Scientific notation justified (1,000 VMs × completions/sec × multipliers × completion bonuses)
- Not "click for +1", but "I built a token-printing empire"

**The collection is the content:**
- 1,000 variants = 1,000 bullet upgrade opportunities
- 1,000 variants = 1,000 potential farming candidates
- 1,000 variants = 1,000 optimization puzzles
- Each variant can be completed infinite times for completion bonuses
- **True endgame: Finding the ONE perfect game and farming it to god-tier status**

---

## Key Design Pillars

1. **One bullet = one completed game** - clear, visual, satisfying
2. **Bullet damage = token payout** - optimization directly translates to power
3. **Completion bonuses stack infinitely** - rewards specialization and deep farming
4. **Space Defender as gate** - forces engagement with collection, rewards progression
5. **Universal multipliers** - rewards cascade, make everything stronger
6. **ALL JSON exposed** - if it's in the data, CheatEngine can modify it
7. **Budget scaling** - not "locked" but "too expensive yet"
8. **Multi-window = active scaling** - exponential rewards for active engagement + completion stacking
9. **VMs = passive scaling** - true idle layer, requires setup and optimization
10. **The collection is the content** - 1,000 games = 1,000 bullet upgrade opportunities

## Implementation Notes

### CheatEngine Credit Costs (Example Scaling)

**Lives modification:**
- +1 life: 100 credits
- +2 lives: 250 credits (100 + 150, diminishing returns)
- +3 lives: 475 credits (100 + 150 + 225)
- +5 lives: 1,056 credits
- +10 lives: 5,768 credits
- Formula: Base cost × (1.5^n) where n is the nth modification

**Victory condition change:**
- Change type (dodge_count → time): 5,000 credits (expensive early, cheap late)
- Modify numeric limit (±5): 150 credits per change

**Movement/physics parameters:**
- Modify speed/rotation: 200-500 credits per step
- Modify friction/damping: 300-800 credits per step
- Modify player_size: 500-2,000 credits per 0.1 change

**Victory limit modification:**
- Decrease by 5: 150 credits
- Decrease by 10: 350 credits
- Decrease by 20: 850 credits
- Decrease to minimum (varies by game): 2,000-10,000 credits

**Advanced parameters:**
- Change area_morph_type: 8,000 credits
- Change movement_type: 15,000 credits
- Add/remove enemies: 10,000 credits per enemy type
- Modify score_multiplier_mode: 12,000 credits

### Completion Bonus Tuning

**Base rate: +1% per completion**
- After 100 completions: 2.7× multiplier
- After 500 completions: 144.77× multiplier
- After 1,000 completions: 20,959× multiplier
- After 2,000 completions: 439,264,650× multiplier (insane!)

**Alternative rates (for balance):**
- **+0.5% per completion:** More grindy, but still exponential
  - After 500 completions: 12.02× multiplier
  - After 2,000 completions: 20,959× multiplier (same as +1% at 1,000)

- **+1.5% per completion:** Faster scaling
  - After 100 completions: 4.43× multiplier
  - After 500 completions: 1,668.7× multiplier

**Recommendation:** Start at +1%, add "Completion Bonus Amplifier" upgrade later to increase to +1.5% or +2%

### Multi-Window Instance Limits

**Per-game instance limits:**
- By default: Can only open 1 instance of each unique game (Clone 0, Clone 1, Clone 2, etc.)
- Upgrade "Multi-Instance Alpha" (100,000 tokens): Can open up to 5 instances of same game
- Upgrade "Multi-Instance Beta" (500,000 tokens): Can open up to 10 instances of same game
- Upgrade "Multi-Instance Gamma" (2,000,000 tokens): Can open up to 25 instances of same game

**Window limit vs Instance limit:**
- Window limit = how many total windows can be open (5, 10, 15, 25)
- Instance limit = how many copies of the SAME game can be open (1, 5, 10, 25)
- Example: 25 window limit + 10 instance limit = can open 10 copies of Clone 0, 10 copies of Clone 5, and 5 copies of Clone 12

### VM Assignment Strategy

**Early game (5-10 VMs):**
- Assign your absolute best games (highest token payout)
- Optimize for token generation
- Goal: Build passive income to fund more optimizations

**Mid game (20-50 VMs):**
- Assign a mix: high-payout games + fast-completion games
- Some VMs for income, some VMs for rapid completion bonuses
- Goal: Balance passive income with building completion counts

**Late game (100 VMs, multi-instance):**
- Assign your top 100 games
- Each VM running 10-50 instances
- Focus on games with high completion counts (stacked bonuses)
- Goal: Maximize throughput, build god-tier bullets through passive farming

---

## The Endgame Vision

**What winning feels like:**
- 1,000 / 1,000 games completed
- Top 10 bullets: 1-100 trillion damage each (hyper-farmed with 1,000+ completions)
- Average bullet: 10-100 million damage
- Total arsenal damage: ~50 billion per volley
- DPS: 100 billion
- 100 VMs running 50 games each = 5,000 passive processes
- Passive income: 10^15 tokens per minute (scientific notation)
- Desktop shows: "Active Processes: 5,000 | Token Generation: 8.47e15 /min"
- You can idle-farm Space Defender Level 20 in 10 seconds
- **You've transformed a shovelware collection into an unstoppable arsenal**

**Post-game goals:**
- Push one bullet to 10,000 completions (astronomical damage)
- Optimize every game to 99%+ performance
- Build perfect farming teams for every movement type
- Create the most efficient token/second setup possible
- **The optimization never ends**
