        <p>Just beat level 5 of Neural Core! The token requirement was challenging but the VM upgrade was worth it. Has anyone found good strategies for optimizing Snake variants?</p>

        <p>I've been experimenting with CheatEngine and found some great optimizations. Reducing victory conditions and increasing lives makes a huge difference in token generation rate!</p>

        <p>The collection is amazing! So many games to try. I'm working on recording demos for my top performers. VM automation is going to be a game changer for passive income.</p>

        <p>Found an interesting pattern in the Memory Match games. Some variants have much longer memorization times which makes them way easier to automate. Definitely worth hunting for those!</p>

        <p>Running 5 VMs simultaneously now and the passive token generation is incredible. The key is finding games with low RNG variance so your demos work consistently.</p>

        <p>I'm treating this like Pokemon - gotta catch em all! Building a collection of perfectly optimized games. Each one has such different parameters, it's fascinating to discover what makes each unique.</p>

        <p>The progression system is really well designed. Each Neural Core level gives you exactly what you need to reach the next level faster. Really enjoying the optimization gameplay loop!</p>
